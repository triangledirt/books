[clarity](https://github.com/triangledirt/books/blob/main/Clarity%3B%29.md) is a novella about a couple thrown together at an amusement park (start with this)

## what is your writing process ??

(when i write) i write every day (usually in the morning) for about two hours

i always listen to music (the same song or songs on repeat)

i used to drink tea when i wrote—for a while i had a writing hoodie—mostly my ritual is a writing drink (coffee lately)
