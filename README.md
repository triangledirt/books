## which book should i read first ??

[clarity](https://github.com/triangledirt/books/blob/main/Clarity%3B%29.md) is a good start for a novella

## what is your writing process ??

(when i write) i write every day (usually in the morning) for about two hours

i always listen to music (the same song or songs on repeat)

i used to drink tea when i wrote—for a while i had a writing hoodie—mostly my ritual is a writing drink (coffee lately)

i do a little every day—i dont think about writing when im not doing it—i keep my fingers on the keys the whole time—and i dont stop writing until im finished with the book !!
