\emph{A student leaves.}

DANIEL.  Next!

AMERICA.  I'm from Special Topics in Organic Chemistry.

DANIEL.  Which one?

AMERICA.  Friday mornings.

DANIEL.  Friday mornings.

AMERICA.  America.

DANIEL.  Ahhh, Miss Jones.

AMERICA.  Yes.

DANIEL.  Perfect Test Score Jones.

AMERICA.  So far.

\emph{She goes for the door.}

DANIEL.  What's wrong?

AMERICA.  I do have a question.

DANIEL.  Please.

AMERICA.  Have lunch with me.

DANIEL.  You'd like to ask me your question over lunch?

AMERICA.  No, that's my question.

DANIEL.  You said, ``Have lunch with me.''  That's not a question.

AMERICA.  Will you have lunch with me, please?

DANIEL.  To talk about Special Topics in Organic Chemistry?

AMERICA.  No.

DANIEL.  America.

AMERICA.  I thought you were going to say no.

DANIEL.  I have to.

AMERICA.  I know.  I had to ask anyway.  I'm sorry.

DANIEL.  America.

DANIEL.  Stay, talk.

AMERICA.  About what?

DANIEL.  Special Topics.

AMERICA.  Special topics in what?

DANIEL.  Organic chemistry.

AMERICA.  No.  Bye.

DANIEL.  See you in class?

SANDRO.  Jesus.

DANIEL.  Do you believe that?

SANDRO.  No.

DANIEL.  America Jones.

SANDRO.  Oh shit.

DANIEL.  Yeah.

SANDRO.  And she's smokin?  Jesus.  So what are you gonna do?

DANIEL.  Nothing.

SANDRO.  You're not gonna do nothing.

DANIEL.  That's exactly what I'm going to do.

SANDRO.  She asked you to lunch?

DANIEL.  That's right.

SANDRO.  Take her to lunch.

DANIEL.  If she asked me, wouldn't it be her taking me?

SANDRO.  Go to lunch with her.

DANIEL.  No.

SANDRO.  Pussy.

DANIEL.  I'd lose my job.

SANDRO.  You wouldn't lose your job for taking her to lunch, what?

DANIEL.  Lunch.

SANDRO.  What?

DANIEL.  Lunch.

SANDRO.  What?

DANIEL.  It's not just lunch.

SANDRO.  How do you know?  Maybe she doesn't sleep with you, is that foregone?

DANIEL.  What about Rachel?

SANDRO.  She never had an affair?

DANIEL.  No.

SANDRO.  You sure?

DANIEL.  Do you think Rachel would have an affair?

DANIEL.  I want to though.

SANDRO.  Respect, respect.

DANIEL.  This girl, though.

SANDRO.  You like her, don't you?

DANIEL.  I do.

\section*{Scene 3.  Daniel's office}

\emph{America comes in.}

AMERICA.  I was thinking.

DANIEL.  Miss Jones.

AMERICA.  If we talk about Special Topics in Organic Chemistry, is it okay?

DANIEL.  Is what okay?

AMERICA.  If we go to lunch.

DANIEL.  I shouldn't tell you this, but \ldots I do like you.

AMERICA.  Then come to lunch with me.

DANIEL.  I can't.

AMERICA.  Why, because we might fuck?

DANIEL.  If that happened, I could lose my job.

AMERICA.  Sometimes teachers fuck students.

DANIEL.  If that happened, I would lose my job.

AMERICA.  Do teachers lose their job for having lunch with students?

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  Well, I'm not inviting you to fuck, I'm inviting you to lunch.

DANIEL.  But we might fuck?

AMERICA.  We might.

\emph{She closes his office door.}

DANIEL.  Open that.

\emph{She opens it.}

AMERICA.  Alright.

DANIEL.  Alright?

AMERICA.  I'll talk about Special Topics in Organic Chemistry.

DANIEL.  You will.

AMERICA.  Sure.  Pick a topic.

DANIEL.  Heterocyclic chemistry.

AMERICA.  Nope.

DANIEL.  Medicinal chemistry.

AMERICA.  Too boring.

DANIEL.  You pick one then.

AMERICA.  You're the teacher.

DANIEL.  I thought you wanted to talk.

AMERICA.  I want to talk over lunch.

DANIEL.  I can't.

AMERICA.  I have to go then.

DANIEL.  Why?

AMERICA.  I'm hungry.

DANIEL.  I'm hungry too.

AMERICA.  Then eat.

DANIEL.  What are you eating?

AMERICA.  Steak.

DANIEL.  I'm a vegetarian.

AMERICA.  Too bad.

\emph{She goes out.}

DANIEL.  Wait.

\emph{He grabs his coat.}

\section*{Scene 4.  At lunch}

DANIEL.  You said we were eating steak.

AMERICA.  I lied, I can't afford it.  This is what I can afford, so we're here.

DANIEL.  This is fine.

AMERICA.  Anyway, aren't you a vegetarian?

DANIEL.  No, I lied too.

AMERICA.  Get a salad.

DANIEL.  No, I really did lie.  I lie sometimes.

AMERICA.  I do too.  I lie about stuff that doesn't even matter.

DANIEL.  Like what?

AMERICA.  Like what my favorite color is.  Why should I tell people that?

DANIEL.  What is your favorite color?

AMERICA.  Blue.

DANIEL.  So it's really red or something.

AMERICA.  Right.  Why do people even care?

DANIEL.  Do people ask you that a lot?

AMERICA.  You're making fun of me.

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  You are, I can feel it.

DANIEL.  I was.  I'm sorry.

AMERICA.  It's okay.  You think I'm too young.

DANIEL.  Too young for what?

AMERICA.  To talk to.  You think I'm stupid.

DANIEL.  I know you're not stupid.

AMERICA.  Not about Chemistry.

DANIEL.  America, I didn't mean to offend you.

AMERICA.  It's okay.  Give me a bite.

DANIEL.  Sure.

AMERICA.  Here \ldots there \ldots oooh \ldots perfect.

DANIEL.  Like it?

AMERICA.  Love it.  Mmm.  Have a bite of mine.

DANIEL.  Mmm.

AMERICA.  I'm getting that next time.

DANIEL.  I'm getting that next time.

AMERICA.  Seriously?

DANIEL.  Yeah.

AMERICA.  Let's switch.

DANIEL.  Okay.

AMERICA.  You seem young.

DANIEL.  I'm not though.

AMERICA.  Your mind \ldots just seems young.  Do you feel young?

DANIEL.  Mostly.  Not my knees.

AMERICA.  What's wrong with them?

DANIEL.  They hurt.

AMERICA.  Are they still the originals?

DANIEL.  Sadly.

AMERICA.  Originals are better.

DANIEL.  Not in knees.

AMERICA.  We connect.

DANIEL.  I feel we do.

AMERICA.  I feel it too.

DANIEL.  Promise me something.

AMERICA.  What.

DANIEL.  Don't be mad at me if we can't be \ldots whatever we might have been.

AMERICA.  So we can't be polo buds.

DANIEL.  I have a wife.

AMERICA.  Does she play?

DANIEL.  You're not married.  You don't know what it's like.

AMERICA.  I'm not her.  I'm not gonna try to live her life, or live---

DANIEL.  And it's not like I don't love her.

AMERICA.  ---or live how it'll be convenient for her, how could I do that?

DANIEL.  You're wise beyond your years.

AMERICA.  Gimme another bite.

DANIEL.  You're not mad?

AMERICA.  Don't want to talk about it.

DANIEL.  Do you have a boyfriend?

AMERICA.  \emph{(with her mouth full)} Yeah I suck dick every night, don't you wish it was you?

DANIEL.  Do you really have a boyfriend?

AMERICA.  No.

DANIEL.  What are we gonna do after this?

AMERICA.  I didn't know we were going to do anything after this.

DANIEL.  I have a class at eight-forty, but \ldots

AMERICA.  We don't have to do anything.

DANIEL.  We could take a walk.  If you want.

AMERICA.  Good.

DANIEL.  Good.

AMERICA.  But, what if people think we're lovers?

DANIEL.  They might think we're just talking.

AMERICA.  What would you and I be talking about?

DANIEL.  Special Topics.

AMERICA.  Very special topics.

DANIEL.  In organic chemistry.

AMERICA.  Of course.

DANIEL.  Let's go.

\section*{Scene 5.  Their walk, publicly, on the green}

DANIEL.  I saw this woman today.  She was about forty-five years old, maybe fifty, and \ldots you know how time makes us tired?  She wasn't tired like that.  At twenty-eight, you can start to see sadness on the face, but this woman, no.  Some people have grace.  It's not born, and it's not bred.  I think maybe it's cultivated.  Anyway, she had it, and \ldots it was beautiful.

AMERICA.  Keep talking.

DANIEL.  What about?

AMERICA.  Anything.  You're a wonderful talker.  You talk in essays.  Not essays, but full paragraphs.  That's something I noticed about you on the first day.  You talk like a book.  You're not dry, but \ldots  It's like a book has already been written and you stand in front of the class and recite it.

DANIEL.  Do you ever feel like you missed a moment?

AMERICA.  Missed a moment?

DANIEL.  You should have, you didn't though, there was something you could have---

AMERICA.  Yeah, no, yeah.  I mean, yeah.  Sure.  All the time.  You feel that?

DANIEL.  Yeah.

AMERICA.  Wha'd you miss?

DANIEL.  A kiss.

AMERICA.  When?

DANIEL.  Long ago.

AMERICA.  Describe it for me.

DANIEL.  I was near your age---how old are you?

AMERICA.  Twenty-one.  How old are you?

DANIEL.  Fifty.  I was twenty-one.  There was this girl.

AMERICA.  You were in college?

DANIEL.  Yes.

AMERICA.  Where?

DANIEL.  It doesn't matter.

AMERICA.  Was this when you were at Amherst?

DANIEL.  Stalker!

AMERICA.  It's on your site, sorry.

DANIEL.  There was this girl.  I should have kissed her.  I didn't.

AMERICA.  You're right you should have.

DANIEL.  I know.

AMERICA.  Did you make the same mistake twice though?

DANIEL.  I've made that one a couple of times.

AMERICA.  Never do that.

DANIEL.  I know.

AMERICA.  That's the only sin.

DANIEL.  Murder?

AMERICA.  Don't ever make the same mistake twice.

DANIEL.  You've killed someone?

AMERICA.  Only one time that I shouldn't have, and I learned my lesson.

DANIEL.  You're a sage.

AMERICA.  People always say that.

DANIEL.  It's true.

AMERICA.  Doesn't feel like that from the inside.

DANIEL.  What does it feel like?

AMERICA.  Confused.  Disconnected.

DANIEL.  I have that.

AMERICA.  Which one?

DANIEL.  Disconnected.

AMERICA.  Who do you hang out with?  Who are your friends?

DANIEL.  Faculty.

AMERICA.  Which ones?

DANIEL.  Sandro, he's the head of the---

AMERICA.  Math department.

DANIEL.  You take math?

AMERICA.  No, my friend takes him, says he's weird.

DANIEL.  He's a nut, but---

AMERICA.  What's his specialty again?  Something like \ldots

DANIEL.  Numbers between zero and one.

AMERICA.  Right, that's \ldots  Do you do math?

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  What do you guys do?

DANIEL.  We play pool.

AMERICA.  No shit, that's what me and my friends do!

DANIEL.  Where at?

AMERICA.  In the quad.  It's a dollar an hour on Thursdays.

DANIEL.  Is it.

AMERICA.  Where do you play?

DANIEL.  A townie bar on Court Street.

AMERICA.  Which one?

DANIEL.  The Smiling Skull.

AMERICA.  Ewww.

DANIEL.  What.

AMERICA.  I got too drunk there.

DANIEL.  Yeah?

AMERICA.  I was going to say once but it was more than once.

DANIEL.  You drink a lot?

AMERICA.  Once I get started.

DANIEL.  What do you drink?

AMERICA.  Whatever.  What do you drink?

DANIEL.  Whatever.

AMERICA.  Now you're lying.

DANIEL.  My drink makes me sound old.

AMERICA.  What is it?

DANIEL.  Scotch.

AMERICA.  Never tried it.

DANIEL.  It's disgusting, till you get used to it.

AMERICA.  All tastes are that way.

DANIEL.  What do you drink?

AMERICA.  Beer.

DANIEL.  Ewww.

AMERICA.  Why?

DANIEL.  I can't drink it.

AMERICA.  You can't drink any of it?

DANIEL.  It's disgusting.

AMERICA.  I bet Scotch is impossible.

DANIEL.  It's fairly impossible.

AMERICA.  You should date me.

DANIEL.  What do you think this is?

AMERICA.  This is just a walk.

DANIEL.  I shouldn't have said that.

AMERICA.  Why?

DANIEL.  You're less than half my age.

AMERICA.  I thought you didn't do math.

DANIEL.  I don't.

AMERICA.  Liar.

DANIEL.  Tease.

AMERICA.  You love it.

DANIEL.  I do.

AMERICA.  You should kiss me.

DANIEL.  Here?

AMERICA.  Yes.

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  Yes.  Kiss me.

DANIEL.  I can't.

AMERICA.  Why not?  It's just a kiss.

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  Kiss me on the lips, no tongue.

DANIEL.  Why no tongue?

AMERICA.  Ewww, we're in public, that's disgusting!

DANIEL.  Okay.

AMERICA.  No P.D.A.

DANIEL.  But kiss you?

AMERICA.  No tongue P.D.A.

DANIEL.  You could get me fired.

AMERICA.  I know, that's not my goal.

DANIEL.  I know.

AMERICA.  Kiss.

\emph{They kiss.}

\section*{Scene 6.  Daniel's and his wife's bedroom}

\emph{Daniel comes into the bedroom, his wife is in bed.}

RACHEL.  How was it?

DANIEL.  Same.

RACHEL.  Are you gonna have time to go with us on Saturday?

DANIEL.  Sure.

\emph{He climbs in bed.}

\section*{Scene 7.  At the bar}

DANIEL.  I've got a real problem.

SANDRO.  And what would that be?

DANIEL.  This girl is hot for me.

SANDRO.  You've got a simple choice to make.

DANIEL.  It's not that simple.

SANDRO.  I didn't say it was easy.  I said it was simple.

DANIEL.  It's not simple.

SANDRO.  Does the girl like you.

DANIEL.  I just said she was hot for me.

SANDRO.  Are you hot for her?

DANIEL.  What does that matter?

SANDRO.  It matters everything.

DANIEL.  But my wife.

SANDRO.  Doesn't she know?

DANIEL.  No!

SANDRO.  You haven't told her.

DANIEL.  Why would I tell her?

SANDRO.  Because you love her.

DANIEL.  I would tell her because I love her?  It would kill her if she knew.

SANDRO.  If she knew?  What do you mean if she knew?

DANIEL.  If she knew that I like this girl!

SANDRO.  I'm sure she knows that already.

DANIEL.  No.

SANDRO.  Wives know.

DANIEL.  I've never even mentioned her name.

SANDRO.  Women are very sensitive.

DANIEL.  I know.

SANDRO.  They can tell.

DANIEL.  I know.

SANDRO.  They can, trust me.  She knows.  And your little girlfriend knows too.

DANIEL.  What does she know now?

SANDRO.  That you haven't told your wife.

DANIEL.  What the fuck difference does that make?

SANDRO.  It makes a difference \ldots if \ldots she thinks you're keeping her at a distance.

DANIEL.  Another shot of this, right away.  A double.

SANDRO.  I'll go again as well.

DANIEL.  It's on me.

SANDRO.  It's always on you.

DANIEL.  I make more.

SANDRO.  And you're more stressed.

DANIEL.  No shit.  How's your love life?

SANDRO.  Nonexistent.

DANIEL.  Fabulous, why don't you get laid.

SANDRO.  Give me your little hottie's number.

DANIEL.  No chance.

SANDRO.  Then get with the girl.

DANIEL.  No chance.  That girl is trouble.

SANDRO.  Girls are never trouble.

DANIEL.  Girls are always trouble.

SANDRO.  You're right.

DANIEL.  No, you are right.  They're wonderful.  I love them.

SANDRO.  Not all of them.

DANIEL.  Of course not, but the beautiful ones.

SANDRO.  I love them too my friend.

DANIEL.  How's your love life?

SANDRO.  I told you, nonexistent.

DANIEL.  Any students to speak of?

SANDRO.  Not that are hounding my bones my friend.

DANIEL.  Too bad.

SANDRO.  That is too bad.

DANIEL.  You want her number?

SANDRO.  Too much chaos for me.

DANIEL.  Yeah, right.  Thank you, we'll go ahead another round.

SANDRO.  On me.

DANIEL.  No.

SANDRO.  On me this time.

DANIEL.  Yes?  Sweet, on him, make those triples.

SANDRO.  You are an addict, my friend.

DANIEL.  I'm fully aware of that.

SANDRO.  As long as you know.

DANIEL.  Believe me, I know.

SANDRO.  You need to get with that girl.

DANIEL.  Why?

SANDRO.  It'll make you sane again.

DANIEL.  I am sane.

SANDRO.  But you've lost something.

DANIEL.  I know.

\section*{Scene 8.  Daniel's office}

\emph{A student leaves.}

DANIEL.  Next!

AMERICA.  I'm from Special Topics in Organic Chemistry?

DANIEL.  Special topics, huh?

AMERICA.  Yeah.

DANIEL.  Close the door.

\emph{She closes the door.}

AMERICA.  Come play pool with me tonight, with me and my friends.

DANIEL.  I can't.

AMERICA.  Why not?

DANIEL.  At the quad?  Everyone will see me.

AMERICA.  Like anyone cares.

DANIEL.  Am I flattering myself?

AMERICA.  Maybe.

DANIEL.  It's too public.

AMERICA.  Somewhere else.

DANIEL.  Where?

AMERICA.  A dive bar.

DANIEL.  Which one?

AMERICA.  Some dive bar, I don't know.  You pick one.

DANIEL.  You think I know dive bars?

AMERICA.  In and out.

DANIEL.  Your last paper was perfect, Miss Jones.

AMERICA.  It's Mrs.

DANIEL.  You're married?

AMERICA.  Didn't you know?

DANIEL.  Tell me you're not.

AMERICA.  I'm not.

DANIEL.  Is that the truth?

AMERICA.  Come out with me.

DANIEL.  With them.

AMERICA.  Us.

DANIEL.  Who.

AMERICA.  It's poets, you'd like them.

DANIEL.  I'd probably hate them, I hate everyone.

AMERICA.  Lovely.

DANIEL.  Especially poets.

AMERICA.  Come out.

DANIEL.  We'd have to go somewhere private.

AMERICA.  Pick a place.

DANIEL.  There's only one place.

AMERICA.  Where?

DANIEL.  Hoek's.

AMERICA.  Where the fuck is that?

DANIEL.  It's private.

AMERICA.  Good.

DANIEL.  It's a dive bar.

AMERICA.  Great.

DANIEL.  You won't like it, the men are disgusting.

AMERICA.  That's the draw?

DANIEL.  Spot on.

AMERICA.  You're such a faggot.

DANIEL.  All professors are.

AMERICA.  Really?

DANIEL.  Yeah, we're all sexually weird.

AMERICA.  Really.

DANIEL.  Part of the job description.

AMERICA.  Come with me.

DANIEL.  Who are these friends?

AMERICA.  Poets.

DANIEL.  You said.

AMERICA.  They are.

DANIEL.  But who.

AMERICA.  Andrew.  Don't worry, he's a fag.

DANIEL.  Be careful.

AMERICA.  Will I lose you now?

DANIEL.  You might, if you introduce sufficiently attractive faggots.

AMERICA.  He's goth.

DANIEL.  I hate goth.

AMERICA.  So I'm safe then.

\emph{She presses herself to him.}

DANIEL.  You're insane.

AMERICA.  Tell me something I don't know.

DANIEL.  Do you play rugby?

AMERICA.  Why?

DANIEL.  Cause all the craziest girls I know play rugby.

AMERICA.  Rugby players are all lesbians.

DANIEL.  Not your game?

AMERICA.  No.

DANIEL.  Why'd your parents name you that?

AMERICA.  I don't know.  They're patriotic.

DANIEL.  Really?

AMERICA.  No, they're leftist revolutionaries.

DANIEL.  Like you said.

AMERICA.  Let's talk about you.

DANIEL.  Me?

AMERICA.  Politically.

DANIEL.  Let's not.

AMERICA.  Why?

DANIEL.  One clue, I'm not a leftist revolutionary.

AMERICA.  I don't mind if we vote for different people.

DANIEL.  You're barely old enough to vote.

AMERICA.  Does that excite you?

DANIEL.  Does it excite you?  You really find me appealing?

AMERICA.  Shut the fuck up.

DANIEL.  No, how?  How do you like me?  I'm an old man.

AMERICA.  Fifty isn't old.

DANIEL.  I wish that was true.

AMERICA.  You need to shut the fuck up, right now.  Kiss me.

\emph{They kiss, he pulls away.}

AMERICA.  What?

DANIEL.  I have a job.  This is my job.

AMERICA.  The door is closed.

DANIEL.  Teacher-student conference?

DANIEL.  No.  Seriously, no.  How did you get to be such a nymph?

AMERICA.  It's innate.

DANIEL.  Genetic?

AMERICA.  Yes.

DANIEL.  How'd you get to be so smart?

AMERICA.  No idea.

AMERICA.  See, this is a teacher-student conference.

DANIEL.  Um, no.

AMERICA.  Relax.

DANIEL.  Did you lock the door?

AMERICA.  Does it have a lock?

DANIEL.  You need to go.

AMERICA.  You might need me to go.  I don't need to go.

DANIEL.  I'm going to introduce you to my wife.

AMERICA.  When is this?

DANIEL.  Whenever.  I want you to see what I'm up against.

AMERICA.  I don't give a shit about your wife.

DANIEL.  And you shouldn't.

AMERICA.  I really don't.  That's your problem.

DANIEL.  You would like her if you met her.

AMERICA.  I hope I never do.

DANIEL.  That's nice.

AMERICA.  I'm not nice.

DANIEL.  I noticed.

AMERICA.  Nice is severely overrated.

DANIEL.  So you say.

AMERICA.  Nice is always the predecessor to an insult.

DANIEL.  Poets, huh?

AMERICA.  She's such a nice person, but, I hate her.  Yes.  Poets, pool, drinks.

DANIEL.  What are we gonna drink?

AMERICA.  It's your bar, motherfucker.

DANIEL.  Scotch.

AMERICA.  Fine.

DANIEL.  You'll drink Scotch.

AMERICA.  If you are.

DANIEL.  I'll get fired.

AMERICA.  Do you like your job?

DANIEL.  No, I like you.

AMERICA.  Right answer.  Grab my tit.

DANIEL.  Not now.

AMERICA.  Fool.

DANIEL.  I know.

AMERICA.  This is one of those missed moments, one of those moments \ldots

DANIEL.  I know.

AMERICA.  Be with me.  Be here.

DANIEL.  I am.

AMERICA.  Be here.  Now.

DANIEL.  I am.

AMERICA.  Come with me.

DANIEL.  America, you are beautiful.  Why'd your parents name you that?

AMERICA.  They're hippies.

DANIEL.  Really.

AMERICA.  Yeah.  We smoke pot together and everything.

DANIEL.  You smoke pot with your parents?

AMERICA.  We used to, I stopped smoking.

DANIEL.  Why?

AMERICA.  I'll tell you later.

DANIEL.  Tell me now.

AMERICA.  What got you into chemistry?

DANIEL.  Just fascinated me.

AMERICA.  Are you kinky Daniel?

DANIEL.  Define kinky.

AMERICA.  Choking, tying up.  Punching in the face.

DANIEL.  Punching in he face?  Jesus.

AMERICA.  That's what Sandro says.

DANIEL.  Jesus?  Yes.  Have you met Sandro?

AMERICA.  My friend says he says that.

AMERICA.  No.

DANIEL.  Good.

AMERICA.  Are you jealous?

DANIEL.  Yes.

AMERICA.  What about your wife?

DANIEL.  Don't bring her up.

AMERICA.  I thought you were going to introduce me.

DANIEL.  Changed my mind.

AMERICA.  Yeah?

DANIEL.  Decided to keep you to myself.

AMERICA.  Good.

DANIEL.  So this boy.

AMERICA.  He's not my boyfriend.

DANIEL.  No?

AMERICA.  He might be gay.

DANIEL.  Is that ecstasy?

AMERICA.  Give me your tongue.

DANIEL.  You take that?

AMERICA.  I have.

DANIEL.  How many times?

AMERICA.  Give me your tongue.

DANIEL.  Maybe in a minute.

AMERICA.  Did you take it?

DANIEL.  Yeah, I found your stash, they're all gone.

\emph{She sticks her head out.  He puts down the paperweight.}

AMERICA.  Two weeks ago.

DANIEL.  Who with?

AMERICA.  My friends.  I was always curious about it.

DANIEL.  Yeah.  Me too.

AMERICA.  Have you rolled?

\emph{She's done changing, but she keeps her body hidden under the covers for now.}

DANIEL.  I probably shouldn't say this.  But \ldots

AMERICA.  It's okay, a lot of people have tried it.

DANIEL.  I definitely shouldn't say this.

AMERICA.  So what, you tried ecstasy.

DANIEL.  You know I'm a chemist \ldots

AMERICA.  You make it?

DANIEL.  I make \ldots other things.

AMERICA.  You sell stuff?

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  You sell it to someone who sells it.

DANIEL.  I make it for myself.

\emph{She gets out of bed and goes to him.}

AMERICA.  So, these are some of the special topics you don't cover in class.

DANIEL.  You're covering some special topics yourself.

AMERICA.  Did you eat it?

DANIEL.  Here.

AMERICA.  I want what you're having.  Do you have something with you?

DANIEL.  This cannot go beyond us.

AMERICA.  We're alone.

DANIEL.  It'll hurt.  What I have to give you will hurt.

AMERICA.  What is it?  When does it hurt?

DANIEL.  It \ldots will \ldots hurt.

AMERICA.  I \ldots like \ldots pain.

DANIEL.  It will hurt \ldots going in \ldots so to speak.

AMERICA.  It's a shot?

DANIEL.  Yes.

AMERICA.  And you'll give it to me.

DANIEL.  You must think I'm insane.

AMERICA.  It turns me on.

DANIEL.  Well yeah.  That's the whole point.

AMERICA.  Have you done this with other women?

DANIEL.  Like students?

AMERICA.  Like \ldots your wife.

DANIEL.  No.  She doesn't like shots.

AMERICA.  Well I do.  Give it to me, let's go in the bathroom.

DANIEL.  We'll do it right here.

AMERICA.  We'll do it right here?

DANIEL.  And here \ldots

AMERICA.  Give it to me.

DANIEL.  Okay.

AMERICA.  Will I still be myself?

DANIEL.  You don't have to do this.

AMERICA.  Where's that pill?

DANIEL.  Don't mix and match.

AMERICA.  We used to say don't trick or treat when I went to A.A.

DANIEL.  You went to A.A.?

AMERICA.  In high school.

DANIEL.  What's trick or treat?

AMERICA.  Hooking up with an addict.  It's bad, you always relapse.

DANIEL.  How much did you used to drink?

AMERICA.  That's how I met my last boyfriend.

DANIEL.  At an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?

AMERICA.  Yeah, then we went to Denny's and dropped acid.

DANIEL.  God.

AMERICA.  Do people really say dropped cause I always say took but I figured---

DANIEL.  That I would know, somehow.

AMERICA.  That since you grew up in the sixties \ldots

DANIEL.  In the sixties I was five.

AMERICA.  I'm less nervous now.  You're good with people.

DANIEL.  My bedside manner coming through.

AMERICA.  Pretend you're my doctor.

DANIEL.  That's sick, that's sick.  I knew you were a freak.  I love that about you.

AMERICA.  Check me for cancer.

DANIEL.  Jesus!

AMERICA.  (pleading for the wait to be over, she's nervous) Is that shot ready?

DANIEL.  Hold on.  You really want to do it this way?

AMERICA.  Would you stick the needle in my fucking arm.

DANIEL.  This might be different than things you've tried before.

AMERICA.  Why, because it's laced with strychnine?

DANIEL.  This isn't something standard, it's something I made.

AMERICA.  Genius, you're a genius.  What is its chemical shape, tell me.

DANIEL.  It contains barium.

AMERICA.  That's a muscle relaxant, right?

DANIEL.  In small doses.

AMERICA.  Is this gonna be a small dose?

DANIEL.  Yes.  A large dose would paralyze you.

AMERICA.  Don't make it too small though.

DANIEL.  I'll make it medium.

AMERICA.  What else does it have?

DANIEL.  Let's not talk shop.

AMERICA.  Really, you made this?  You're a genius.  What does it do to you?

DANIEL.  It just feels good.

AMERICA.  Where?

DANIEL.  You'll see.

AMERICA.  Where?

DANIEL.  Everywhere.

AMERICA.  It's not not gonna make me stupid is it?

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  If it did why would you take it.

DANIEL.  Not right away anyway.

AMERICA.  Seriously.

DANIEL.  It won't make you stupid.

AMERICA.  Might paralyze me though.

DANIEL.  Right.

AMERICA.  I'm okay with paralysis.

DANIEL.  Okay.  Hold this.

\emph{He gives her the paperweight.}

AMERICA.  Like this?

DANIEL.  Squeeze.

AMERICA.  Got it.

DANIEL.  Tighter.  Hold.

AMERICA.  Phew.

DANIEL.  You okay?

\emph{She nods.}

DANIEL.  You sure?

AMERICA.  Go.  Wait.  I want to tell you something.  There's one problem.

DANIEL.  You don't want to.

AMERICA.  I want to, I want to, I've been dying to.

DANIEL.  I am insane.

AMERICA.  Would you shut the fuck up.  I've been meaning to tell you this.

DANIEL.  You always surprise me, every time we're together, I love that.

AMERICA.  There's something about me that I want you to know.  I'm a virgin.

DANIEL.  That's okay.

\emph{He gives her the shot.  Her arm goes limp, her head rolls back.  The paperweight hits the floor.}

\section*{Scene 10.  A month later, her place}

\emph{They're kneeling on the floor.  Silently, ritually, she shoots him up.}

AMERICA.  Here we are.

DANIEL.  Yes, here we are.

\emph{She does herself.}

AMERICA.  Damn.

DANIEL.  What?

AMERICA.  I love what it does to your ears.

DANIEL.  Describe how it seems to you.

AMERICA.  Like we're in a tube.

DANIEL.  Is the music okay?

AMERICA.  The music is more than okay.

DANIEL.  Tell me if you want me to change anything.

AMERICA.  Change nothing, just lie.

DANIEL.  Just lie.

AMERICA.  Yeah.  Be.  Be be be.

DANIEL.  Sing for me.

\emph{She half-sits up to try.}

AMERICA.  I can't right now.

DANIEL.  That's okay.  I love your voice.

AMERICA.  Thanks.

DANIEL.  You have a spunk-ness about you.  It's like \ldots  I saw this singer once.

AMERICA.  A girlfriend?

DANIEL.  I saw her on T.V.

AMERICA.  I like it when you tell me about women.

DANIEL.  She had this same spunk-ness as you.

AMERICA.  I like to hear about women you've loved.

DANIEL.  Well I never loved this one.

AMERICA.  You loved her through the television.

DANIEL.  True.

AMERICA.  I bet you kissed the T.V.

DANIEL.  I should have.

AMERICA.  No, you might have electrocuted yourself.

DANIEL.  Only if I kissed with tongue.

AMERICA.  I wouldn't want that to happen to my baby.

DANIEL.  Anyway you two are similar.  You have the same \ldots it's a spark \ldots

AMERICA.  I think children can see auras.

DANIEL.  Children see more than we do.  We've been taught not to see.

AMERICA.  These children in the park this weekend, they were looking at me.

DANIEL.  They were looking at you because you are beautiful.

AMERICA.  They were like angels.  They stopped playing and stared right at me.

DANIEL.  They looked like angels?

AMERICA.  Yes.

DANIEL.  You were an angel to them.

AMERICA.  No.

DANIEL.  You were, I know it.

AMERICA.  You think so?

DANIEL.  I know it.  Children can see angels.  And you \ldots are an angel.

AMERICA.  You think I am, for real?

DANIEL.  Trust me, you are.

AMERICA.  I know.

DANIEL.  I was hoping you did.  It's sad when people don't \ldots

AMERICA.  When people don't \ldots

DANIEL.  \ldots know who they are.

AMERICA.  What are you?  Tell me you know.

DANIEL.  I know.

AMERICA.  What.

DANIEL.  I'm insane.  I'm a fool.  I'm a doctor.  I'm the father of time.

AMERICA.  No doubt.

DANIEL.  I am the father of time.

AMERICA.  Yes you are.  I'm glad you know that.

DANIEL.  I'm glad you can hear that.

AMERICA.  I can.

DANIEL.  I'm a scientist.

AMERICA.  You are.

DANIEL.  I mean, I'm a real scientist.

AMERICA.  I know.

DANIEL.  I'm real.

AMERICA.  You are real.

DANIEL.  You're real yourself.

AMERICA.  I'm too young to be real.

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  No?

DANIEL.  No.  There is no too young to be real.

AMERICA.  I'm glad you think so.

DANIEL.  There isn't.

AMERICA.  I need you to like me.

DANIEL.  Why is that?  You could have any boy out there.

AMERICA.  Because you're not a boy.

DANIEL.  You could have any boy you want.

AMERICA.  Because you're not a boy.

DANIEL.  And why do I like you?  Do you have the foresight to know, my sage?

AMERICA.  Hmmm.

DANIEL.  Choose carefully.

AMERICA.  Why, what happens if I'm wrong?

DANIEL.  I have no idea.  Nothing.

AMERICA.  What's the fun in that?

DANIEL.  Fine, I'll spank you.

AMERICA.  That's not a punishment.

DANIEL.  I'll stab you in the neck.

AMERICA.  With a syringe?

DANIEL.  Sure.

AMERICA.  You will.  If I'm wrong?  You'll stab me in the neck?

DANIEL.  Sure.

AMERICA.  What was the question again?

DANIEL.  Why do I like you.

AMERICA.  And this is where I should choose carefully?

DANIEL.  Yes.

AMERICA.  You will inject me in my jugular?

DANIEL.  Yes.

AMERICA.  If I choose wrong.

DANIEL.  Yes.

AMERICA.  You will.

DANIEL.  Yes.

AMERICA.  You're sure.

DANIEL.  Yes, I will!

AMERICA.  Okay, why do you like me?  Because I'm young \ldots no.

DANIEL.  That's not your answer?

AMERICA.  No.

DANIEL.  Fine.

AMERICA.  Because I \ldots no.  Because \ldots  This is too much pressure.

DANIEL.  I'll stab you in the neck either way.

AMERICA.  No you won't you'll only stab me in the neck if I'm wrong.

DANIEL.  Oh.

AMERICA.  Fine.

DANIEL.  Fine?

AMERICA.  Stab me in the next either way.

DANIEL.  I thought so.

AMERICA.  I'll still guess.

DANIEL.  Good.

AMERICA.  You like me because \ldots it's not because I'm young?

DANIEL.  Is that your guess?

AMERICA.  Young implies so many things.  You could like me cause I'm innocent.

DANIEL.  Except you are not innocent.

AMERICA.  Anymore.  Not since you.

DANIEL.  No, not since me.

AMERICA.  I think that's still the reason.

DANIEL.  What.

AMERICA.  Because I'm young.

DANIEL.  You're wrong.

AMERICA.  Not literally that I'm young.  Like I'm twenty-one doesn't get you off---

DANIEL.  Are you sure?

AMERICA.  That isn't it.

DANIEL.  Well \ldots

AMERICA.  That might be part of it.

DANIEL.  That's part of it.

AMERICA.  I'm okay with that.

DANIEL.  You're a strange one.

AMERICA.  No, I'm typical.

DANIEL.  You're not.

AMERICA.  Young women love old guys.

DANIEL.  Oh.

AMERICA.  Not that you're old.

DANIEL.  But I am.

AMERICA.  You're aged \ldots

DANIEL.  And what are you?

AMERICA.  \ldots there's nothing wrong with that.

DANIEL.  I'll stab you in the neck.

AMERICA.  Go.

DANIEL.  Answer my question.

AMERICA.  Because I'm young.

DANIEL.  You said that.

AMERICA.  The color of my hair.

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  My breasts.

DANIEL.  No.  That's \ldots part of it.

AMERICA.  I can't answer your question.

DANIEL.  Try.

AMERICA.  Because.  I was a virgin.

DANIEL.  That is special.  But that's not the real reason.

AMERICA.  Just shoot me up.

DANIEL.  This stuff \ldots

AMERICA.  Stop.

DANIEL.  \ldots this \ldots

AMERICA.  Stop.  Shut up.

DANIEL.  \ldots this stuff \ldots

AMERICA.  Go.  In my neck, go in my neck.

DANIEL.  You have to hold very still.

AMERICA.  I will.

DANIEL.  I'm talking very still.

AMERICA.  I'm still.

DANIEL.  Okay.

AMERICA.  Go.

DANIEL.  This will hurt.

AMERICA.  I know.

DANIEL.  Not like before.

AMERICA.  Just go.

DANIEL.  Promise me you will not move.

AMERICA.  Shoot the fucking vein.

DANIEL.  Last time for tonight.

AMERICA.  Fine.

DANIEL.  I'm serious.

AMERICA.  Fine.

DANIEL.  Be very still.

\emph{She is still, he shoots her in the neck.}

DANIEL.  How is that?

AMERICA.  That is fine.

DANIEL.  Yeah?

AMERICA.  Now you go.

DANIEL.  I will.

AMERICA.  I'll help you, or \ldots

DANIEL.  Enjoy yourself.

AMERICA.  I'll shoot you.

DANIEL.  Enjoy yourself.

AMERICA.  Oh \ldots

DANIEL.  I've done this more than you.

AMERICA.  \ldots okay \ldots

\emph{She lies back.  He shoots himself.}

AMERICA.  You good?

DANIEL.  Yeah.

AMERICA.  Yeah?

DANIEL.  Yeah.

AMERICA.  Good, baby, good.  Lie down.

DANIEL.  Okay.

AMERICA.  Now.  I'm gonna tell you a story.

DANIEL.  What kind of story?

AMERICA.  A happy one.

DANIEL.  You want to know something?

AMERICA.  Tell me.

DANIEL.  I'll tell you why I like you.

AMERICA.  Not now.

DANIEL.  I'll tell you why I like you.

AMERICA.  Mmm.

DANIEL.  You don't want to know \ldots

AMERICA.  Tell me later.

\emph{They trip out.}

\section*{Scene 11.  Daniel's office}

\emph{Daniel comes into his office.  Sandro is sitting in his chair.}

DANIEL.  Jesus!

SANDRO.  That's my word.

DANIEL.  You scared me.

SANDRO.  I meant to scare you.

DANIEL.  Well it worked.  You meant to scare me?  Don't be a psychopath.

SANDRO.  I am a mathematician, and my study is the numbers between zero and one.

DANIEL.  I know.

SANDRO.  I know you know.  But, do you know what it is that you do not know?

DANIEL.  What's that?

SANDRO.  That your barium girl will kill you.

DANIEL.  My barium girl.

SANDRO.  Your barium girl.

DANIEL.  Your English is breaking up, Sandro, you need to talk more slowly.

SANDRO.  You understand me fine.

DANIEL.  My barium girl.

SANDRO.  Correct.

DANIEL.  My barium girl.

SANDRO.  You know what I mean.

DANIEL.  I do, and I don't like it.

SANDRO.  What you don't like?

DANIEL.  That you're sitting in my chair.

SANDRO.  Sorry.

DANIEL.  How'd you get in?

SANDRO.  I know the dean.

DANIEL.  The dean let you in here?

SANDRO.  I am not going to lie to you, my friend.  The dean is close to me.

DANIEL.  He's close with me too.

SANDRO.  Better be sure.

DANIEL.  I am sure.  What the fuck is your point?

SANDRO.  You need to watch out with that girl.

DANIEL.  Why?

SANDRO.  People see.

DANIEL.  Who.

SANDRO.  Me.

DANIEL.  Who?

SANDRO.  The dean.

DANIEL.  How?

SANDRO.  He sees.

DANIEL.  How?

SANDRO.  Who knows?  People are talking, though, I warn you.

DANIEL.  Who.

SANDRO.  That Amber White.

DANIEL.  Political Theory?  That bitch.

SANDRO.  Yes.

DANIEL.  That bitch?  She's talking?

SANDRO.  She's not the only one.

DANIEL.  The dean?

SANDRO.  He's mentioned it.

DANIEL.  Jesus.

SANDRO.  That's my word.

DANIEL.  Consider it stolen.

SANDRO.  Fag.

DANIEL.  I am not a fag.

SANDRO.  That seems to be the problem.

DANIEL.  What are they saying?

SANDRO.  They know about the barium.

DANIEL.  It's not barium.

SANDRO.  It's something, and they know about it.

DANIEL.  What could they possibly know?

SANDRO.  I am not a chemist, my friend, and I know.

DANIEL.  What do you know?

SANDRO.  That you're shooting barium.

DANIEL.  It's not just barium.

SANDRO.  But you're shooting it.

DANIEL.  So what?

SANDRO.  So what?

DANIEL.  So what.

SANDRO.  You are shooting barium and you think it's so what?

DANIEL.  No one knows.

SANDRO.  The dean.

DANIEL.  How the fuck does the dean know?

SANDRO.  He knows.

DANIEL.  How?

SANDRO.  Was that girl a virgin?

DANIEL.  No.

SANDRO.  That girl was a virgin.

DANIEL.  What does that have to do with anything?

SANDRO.  How old is she?

DANIEL.  Doesn't the dean know?  If he's complaining, hasn't he looked it up?

SANDRO.  How could I know that?

DANIEL.  She's over age.

SANDRO.  If you say she is, she is.

DANIEL.  She's twenty-one.

SANDRO.  You are sure?

DANIEL.  Should I ask for I.D.?  Before I fuck a girl?  I have to ask for I.D.?

SANDRO.  What you do is up to you.

DANIEL.  I know it is.  Thanks, thanks.

SANDRO.  I hope she was hot, this one.

DANIEL.  Don't worry, she was.

SANDRO.  I hope she was very very hot.

DANIEL.  She was.

SANDRO.  I hope she was.

DANIEL.  She was.

SANDRO.  This chemistry you are shooting, it's not---

DANIEL.  You know jack about chemistry.

SANDRO.  It's not sustainable.

DANIEL.  Neither is sober life.

SANDRO.  It kills you.

DANIEL.  So does sober life.

SANDRO.  It's less sustainable than sober life.

DANIEL.  So.

SANDRO.  It kills you faster than sober life.

DANIEL.  It also \ldots

SANDRO.  What?

DANIEL.  It blows the lid off sober life.

SANDRO.  I'm sure.

DANIEL.  It does.

SANDRO.  Whatever you say.

DANIEL.  I'm trying to make my life better---

SANDRO.  Better than what?

DANIEL.  What do you know?  What do you know about young girls?

SANDRO.  I know they make you crazy.

DANIEL.  You know shit about young girls.

SANDRO.  You think no?

DANIEL.  No.

SANDRO.  You think what you want.

DANIEL.  What girls do you know?

SANDRO.  I have daughters.

DANIEL.  Please.

SANDRO.  What is this please?  Fuck.

DANIEL.  I'm sorry.  Jesus.

SANDRO.  And you stealing my word!  Fuck you!

DANIEL.  Fuck me?

SANDRO.  Fuck you for stealing my word.  I want you still working here---

DANIEL.  I want you out of my office.

SANDRO.  I want you to still keep this job.

DANIEL.  Jobs aren't everything, you know that?  This job is shit.

SANDRO.  This job got you the girl you like.

DANIEL.  She's not because of my job.

SANDRO.  You think that?  She is.

DANIEL.  Get out.

SANDRO.  If you weren't a professor---

DANIEL.  Professors are weird.

SANDRO.  If you weren't a professor---

DANIEL.  She and I connect.

SANDRO.  Because of what?

DANIEL.  Our souls.

SANDRO.  There's no such thing.

DANIEL.  Get out.

SANDRO.  You believe in the soul?

DANIEL.  \emph{(laughing---he really doesn't believe in it)} No.

SANDRO.  You should.

DANIEL.  You're a mathematician.

SANDRO.  So?

DANIEL.  You believe in the soul?

SANDRO.  Yes.

DANIEL.  That's absurd.

SANDRO.  You are a chemist.  How can you say as a mathematician I cannot believe in the soul?

DANIEL.  Our domain is the earth, it's physicality!

SANDRO.  Math is abstract!

DANIEL.  Of what, though?  The earth!  Space!

SANDRO.  Of time, too.

DANIEL.  Of days, they are concrete.  Of years, they are concrete.

SANDRO.  And of love, is that concrete?  The heart?

DANIEL.  There is no such thing as the heart.

SANDRO.  No?

DANIEL.  There is no such thing.

SANDRO.  Then why are you crazy with this girl?

DANIEL.  Because she's young.

SANDRO.  You would risk your job?

DANIEL.  Job??

SANDRO.  Job!!

DANIEL.  Have you ever been in love?  Have you ever been in love!?

SANDRO.  I won't make claims to you.

DANIEL.  Afraid to make the abstract real?

SANDRO.  You will lose everything.

DANIEL.  Some student has flirted with you, I know, and you left her behind---

SANDRO.  You will lose it all for this girl, and you don't care---

DANIEL.  Mathematics is supposed to be hardcore!

SANDRO.  Fuck her without the barium!

DANIEL.  Why do you care?

SANDRO.  The school---

DANIEL.  The school---

SANDRO.  They're going to let you go.

DANIEL.  I've been teaching here for fifteen years.

SANDRO.  My friend, this is the cardinal rule of professorship.

DANIEL.  What's that?

SANDRO.  Your students.  Don't fuck them.

DANIEL.  This girl, though.

SANDRO.  It doesn't matter who she is.

DANIEL.  This girl is special.

SANDRO.  The dean---

DANIEL.  This girl---

SANDRO.  The dean says---

DANIEL.  You should meet her.

SANDRO.  That's a bad idea.

DANIEL.  Why?

SANDRO.  Because.

DANIEL.  The dean says what?  Why's it a bad idea?

SANDRO.  If she's as cool as you say she is \ldots between friends \ldots it's a bad idea.

DANIEL.  And the dean?

SANDRO.  The dean \ldots

DANIEL.  Mathematically speaking, what are my chances?

SANDRO.  Not good.

DANIEL.  Not good.

SANDRO.  No.

DANIEL.  Jesus.

SANDRO.  That's my word.

\section*{Scene 12.  Daniel's office}

DEAN.  Are you with this girl?

DANIEL.  No.

DEAN.  You are with the girl.

DANIEL.  No.

DEAN.  You are with the girl, we know.

DANIEL.  Who's we?  Anyway, so what, yes, I'm with the girl.

DEAN.  You admit you're with that girl?

DANIEL.  I'm with the goddammn girl.  What the fuck do you care?

DEAN.  Are you recording in this room?

DANIEL.  Are you?

DEAN.  It's a P.R.  issue.  It hurts our image.

DEAN.  Not to fuck.

DANIEL.  I am teaching.

DEAN.  We are not paying you to fuck those you teach.

DANIEL.  You are paying me to teach \ldots

DEAN.  Yes.

DANIEL.  And I teach, I teach for you.  Did she say something?

DEAN.  You do teach.

DANIEL.  Did she say something?

DEAN.  She didn't say anything.

DANIEL.  Someone must have said something to you.

DEAN.  Someone has.

DANIEL.  Who.

DEAN.  Someone has.

DANIEL.  Who.

DEAN.  I've seen you two together.

DANIEL.  Where?

DEAN.  The green.

DANIEL.  When.

DEAN.  Last week, all the time, Jesus.

DANIEL.  That's Sandro's word.

DEAN.  Could you show some tact?

DANIEL.  Tact?

DEAN.  Tact.

DANIEL.  Love has no tact.

DEAN.  Is this love?

DANIEL.  Have I tact?

DEAN.  None at all.

DANIEL.  It must be love.

DEAN.  Hide it.

DANIEL.  Why?

DEAN.  Hide it from me.

DANIEL.  Why?

DEAN.  You force my hand.

DANIEL.  Act then.

DEAN.  I have to act.  Students can't \ldots

DANIEL.  Do what?

DEAN.  Students can't \ldots

DANIEL.  Students do more than you think.

DEAN.  They can't be in love with teachers.

DANIEL.  But they are.

DEAN.  No.

DANIEL.  They are.

DEAN.  No.

DANIEL.  They are.  That's your problem.  They can't be, but they are.

DEAN.  Is she really in love with you?

DANIEL.  Yes.

DEAN.  Then hide it.

DANIEL.  Hide?

DEAN.  Hide it from your wife, hide it from me.  Hide it from everyone.

DANIEL.  Why would love hide?

DEAN.  Please.

DANIEL.  Why would it?  Love  never hides!

DEAN.  Because love is crazy, case in point.

DANIEL.  Dismiss me, fine.

DEAN.  You have my nod.

DANIEL.  Mm.

DEAN.  You have every respect from me.

DANIEL.  Mm.

DEAN.  You are the top.  We couldn't have gotten better than you.

DANIEL.  No.

DEAN.  No.

DANIEL.  Well.

DEAN.  It's still a problem.

DANIEL.  What about Pythagoras?

DEAN.  What about him?

DANIEL.  Sex with students.

DEAN.  That was 50 A.D.  or something.  This is two-thousand years later!

DANIEL.  So?!

DEAN.  You can't fuck students anymore.

DANIEL.  The world has changed so much?

DEAN.  Are you a chemist or a philosopher?

DANIEL.  Chemistry is everything.  What about her?

DEAN.  Her?

DANIEL.  What does she say?

DEAN.  She who?

DANIEL.  She, she, come on, she, Jesus.

DEAN.  That's Sandro's word.

DANIEL.  I know.  What does she say?  Have you talked to her?

DEAN.  We've talked to her.

DANIEL.  And what does she say?

DEAN.  She says nothing.

DANIEL.  Now that I can't believe.

DEAN.  It's true.  She protects you.

DANIEL.  Good girl.

DEAN.  You fucked her?

DANIEL.  You wouldn't have done the same?

DEAN.  You gave her barium?

\emph{Daniel is startled.}

DEAN.  Did you mix her barium?

DANIEL.  Have you ever fucked around?

DEAN.  Of course.

DANIEL.  Would you like that of course to come to light?

DEAN.  Of course not.

DANIEL.  Well.

DEAN.  Did you feed this girl barium?

DANIEL.  She likes it.

DEAN.  I don't care.

DANIEL.  It's about your reputation.

DEAN.  Yes.  It's about our reputation.

DANIEL.  Did the dean hit on you when he talked to you?

RACHEL.  Oh, don't you wish that he did, that would make this so easy for you.

DANIEL.  No harm was meant.

RACHEL.  What about our kids!

DANIEL.  I thought of that.

RACHEL.  Children have an idea \ldots of who their parents are.  You can mess kids up.

DANIEL.  Since when did you become a puritan?

RACHEL.  You gave this girl barium?

DANIEL.  What's your point?

RACHEL.  My point---

DANIEL.  You don't even know what barium is.

RACHEL.  So you cut me.

DANIEL.  I didn't mean---

RACHEL.  This is hard for me.

DANIEL.  I didn't mean to cut---

RACHEL.  We are \ldots

DANIEL.  Calm down.

RACHEL.  \ldots you and me are married!

DANIEL.  I know.

RACHEL.  We're married.

DANIEL.  I'm sorry.

RACHEL.  Were the drugs her idea?

DANIEL.  What drugs?

RACHEL.  The barium.

DANIEL.  It's not even barium.

RACHEL.  Whatever.

DANIEL.  Did the dean tell you that?

RACHEL.  Was it her idea?  Tell me that part was her idea.  At least tell me that.

DANIEL.  You want me to lie?

RACHEL.  Yes.

\emph{They embrace.}

DANIEL.  Oh, baby, I love you.

RACHEL.  I love you, too.

DANIEL.  I'm so sorry.

RACHEL.  What are we gonna do?

DANIEL.  What did the dean tell you?

RACHEL.  He told me so many things.

DANIEL.  Did he say I'm fired?

RACHEL.  He said you might be.

DANIEL.  He told you that?

RACHEL.  He indicated.

DANIEL.  If I get fired---

RACHEL.  Don't get fired.

DANIEL.  We can do something else.

RACHEL.  I like it here.

DANIEL.  I know.

RACHEL.  I don't want to move again.  I imagined us getting old here.

DANIEL.  I know.

RACHEL.  I like the river.  And you've liked it here, haven't you?

DANIEL.  Did he say I was definitely getting fired?

RACHEL.  I like those little shops by the river.

DANIEL.  Did he say I was definitely getting fired?

RACHEL.  He was saying very scary things.

DANIEL.  I don't mean to scare you.

RACHEL.  You have your life---

DANIEL.  We have a life together.

RACHEL.  Your life is beyond my life.  My life is simple.

DANIEL.  This is us.

RACHEL.  It's not us anymore.

DANIEL.  Come on \ldots

RACHEL.  Baby, no.  Your life is something else.  I'm just your tagalong.

DANIEL.  I've loved you.

RACHEL.  Our love is different.

DANIEL.  Love \ldots

RACHEL.  We mean different things when we say the word.

DANIEL.  What do you mean when you say it?

RACHEL.  Do you love this girl?

DANIEL.  It's complex.

RACHEL.  Fuck.  Be straight with me.

DANIEL.  I love her.

RACHEL.  Jesus.

DANIEL.  You asked for the truth.

RACHEL.  I know.

DANIEL.  I'm sorry.

RACHEL.  I might go back to school \ldots get my masters \ldots

DANIEL.  For what?

RACHEL.  What do you think?

DANIEL.  Well.  Of course, yeah \ldots

RACHEL.  You're such a dick.  You and me were hot once, you know.

DANIEL.  I remember.

RACHEL.  I hope you think of that next time you're with her.

DANIEL.  Grief.

RACHEL.  I hate that fucking bitch.

DANIEL.  Rachel.

RACHEL.  Next time you're with her, you think of the first time we fucked.

\emph{Rachel goes for the door.}

DANIEL.  Baby.

RACHEL.  Make up your mind.

DANIEL.  Baby \ldots

RACHEL.  When you make up your mind, let me know.

DANIEL.  Where are you going?

RACHEL.  I'm going home, to our home, where we live.

DANIEL.  I'll meet you later.

RACHEL.  Do whatever you like.

DANIEL.  If \ldots

RACHEL.  If what?  If you don't come home?

DANIEL.  If I get fired.  I'll take care of you.

RACHEL.  I don't care.

DANIEL.  I don't want you to worry.

RACHEL.  I'm not looking to be taken care of.

DANIEL.  What?  What?

RACHEL.  I want you to be with me.

DANIEL.  I'm sorry.

RACHEL.  I know, I know, you can't.

\emph{Rachel leaves.  Daniel dials a number.}

DANIEL.   Hey, it's me.  Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry.  No.  I'm \ldots I'm \ldots finishing up.  Well.  Really?  How long has this been going on?  You're such a freak.  I know, I know.  No.  You'll never guess.  Jesus, how did you know that?  I know.  Jesus.  I'm sorry I know.  No, well.  Sure, okay.  Fine, but.  Listen, wait, there's one problem.  Of course there can't be.  No, shit, she's, my wife, she's.  God damn it, I don't know, baby.  Soon.  Very soon.  Yesterday.  I would, I would.  Of course I will, baby, you know me better than that.  Of course.  Of course.  I'll be right there.  Of course.  Listen.  Listen.  Yes.  Look lovely, I may be held up.  Because, because, because \ldots because my wife is sitting outside in the Range Rover shining the lights at my window.  Fuck!

SANDRO.  Daniel, get up.  Daniel.

\emph{Daniel stirs.}

SANDRO.  You have an eight o'clock class.

DANIEL.  What is it?

SANDRO.  It's your survey class.

DANIEL.  I need a shower.

SANDRO.  There's no time for your shower.  There's no time.  Wash in the bathroom.

DANIEL.  Are you sure it's my survey class?

Sandro gathers the drug tools.

DANIEL.  Don't touch that!  What?

SANDRO.  Sorry.

DANIEL.  What are you doing?

SANDRO.  Cleaning up.

DANIEL.  Leave it.

SANDRO.  The dean is in the hallway.  I'm just cleaning up a little.

DANIEL.  I'll do it.

SANDRO.  Go wash.

DANIEL.  Just leave it.  Don't touch it!

SANDRO.  Alright.

DANIEL.  Did you talk to the dean?  Don't lie.

SANDRO.  I wouldn't lie to you.  Yes.  I told him about the girl.

DANIEL.  Thank you.

SANDRO.  That's all, though.

DANIEL.  That is all you told him.

SANDRO.  You are killing yourself my friend.

DANIEL.  That's none of your business.  In fact, you know what?

SANDRO.  What.

DANIEL.  Why don't you get the fuck out of my office.

SANDRO.  I think if you will get a little distance---

DANIEL.  Did you have an appointment scheduled with me?  No.  No you don't.

SANDRO.  Just a little distance from your present life, and come back.

DANIEL.  Now I'll thank you for that wonderful advice, professor, but leave.

SANDRO.  Hide that.

DANIEL.  What's the point.

SANDRO.  He doesn't know about it.

DANIEL.  Yes, thanks for not telling him everything!  Get the fuck out of here.

SANDRO.  I will go, hide that.

DANIEL.  Don't touch it!

SANDRO.  Fine.

DANIEL.  If you touch it again I'm going to slap you in the face.

SANDRO.  Okay.

DANIEL.  You act like a bitch and I am going to slap you like a bitch.

SANDRO.  The dean is outside.

DANIEL.  You think I care about the dean?

SANDRO.  He's right outside your door.

DANIEL.  Oooh, the dean.

SANDRO.  The dean.

DANIEL.  Send him in on your way out.

\emph{Sandro leaves.}

DANIEL.  Come in if you're coming in.

\emph{The dean comes in.  He sits in the chair that Rachel sat in.}

DANIEL.  How are you?

DEAN.  Fine.  How are you?

DANIEL.  Were you thinking of sitting in on my class?

DEAN.  I'm sure that would be interesting, but no, thank you.

DANIEL.  You're welcome to drop by anytime.

DEAN.  I'll keep that in mind.

DANIEL.  I don't think I'm having class today, though.

DEAN.  No.

\emph{Daniel sits at his desk, straightens his shirt.}

DEAN.  I have something to ask you.  I'd like if you'd be calm about it.

DANIEL.  Fire away.

\emph{They both smile.}

DEAN.  May I have your keys?

\emph{Daniel fishes for them.}

DANIEL.  I'll send someone by to pick up my books.

\emph{He gives over his keys.}

DEAN.  We'll send them to you.

\emph{The dean stands, waiting for Daniel to leave first.  Daniel stands, he takes America's paperweight off his desk and leaves.}

\section*{Scene 16.  Daniel and Rachel's bedroom}

\emph{Daniel comes in carrying the paperweight, Rachel is packing.  He sits on the bed and puts the paperweight beside him.}

RACHEL.  Don't put that there.

DANIEL.  What?  Geez.

RACHEL.  That's our bed.

DANIEL.  Not anymore, apparently.

RACHEL.  Not anymore for you either.

DANIEL.  Well, people get tired of things.

RACHEL.  Yes, I know.

DANIEL.  If you would just be reasonable, allow a man the occasional fling.

RACHEL.  She's more than a fling.  Take that off the bed.

DANIEL.  Not everyone can be like you.  We're not all professionally monogamous.

RACHEL.  A little part time monogamy is all I wanted from you.

DANIEL.  It's stifling.  Where are you going?

RACHEL.  Somewhere I can sleep.

DANIEL.  Sleep here.

RACHEL.  You know what it does to me?  Thinking of you with her?

DANIEL.  Baby, why would you do that to yourself?

RACHEL.  I imagine the two of you together, sharing the most intimate thing.

DANIEL.  It's just sex.

RACHEL.  I hope for her sake that isn't true.

DANIEL.  Sometimes it is just sex.

RACHEL.  No.  It never is.

DANIEL.  You never want it anyway.

RACHEL.  Yes I have.

DANIEL.  Not for years.

RACHEL.  It's not just the lack of sex between us.  Take that off the bed.

\emph{She takes it off and puts it in his hands.  As they talk, he plays with it and eventually sets it back down.}

DANIEL.  They took my keys today.

RACHEL.  You knew they would.

DANIEL.  Yeah.

RACHEL.  Why don't you clean up?

DANIEL.  I'm clean.

RACHEL.  They love you there.  You know the dean loves you.  And Sandro.

DANIEL.  I'm through with Sandro.

RACHEL.  Since when?

DANIEL.  Today.

RACHEL.  You call him right now and make up.  You've known him forever.

DANIEL.  No.

RACHEL.  Baby.

DANIEL.  He crossed a line.

RACHEL.  Consider cutting him some slack right now.  He's trying to help you.

DANIEL.  When you help people, you have to respect them at the same time.

RACHEL.  We are all of us clumsy around someone who demands so much.

DANIEL.  What?  Only one thing, that's loyalty from my friends.

RACHEL.  You've got yourself in such a state right now.

DANIEL.  Congratulations to you on staying calm.

RACHEL.  I'm trying to maintain my sanity.

DANIEL.  This world favors the insane.

RACHEL.  That may very well be.

DANIEL.  I have to stop.

RACHEL.  I'll help.

DANIEL.  From where?

RACHEL.  From here.  Just stop with that girl and we'll work on the drugs together.

\emph{Rachel picks up the paperweight.  Daniel gets up from the bed, crosses, looks out the window.  He comes back to his wife.}

RACHEL.  We can stay here.  I know you love this house.

DANIEL.  What about my job?

RACHEL.  They'll let you back.

DANIEL.  No.

RACHEL.  If you want, I'll move anywhere in the world with you.

DANIEL.  I can't.

\emph{He takes the paperweight.}

DANIEL.  I can't.

\section*{Scene 17.  America's place - Dusk}

DANIEL.  What do you mean?

AMERICA.  I mean that's it.

DANIEL.  Gimme that.  It's flatter than before.

AMERICA.  It's getting flatter and flatter all night.

DANIEL.  I mean it's getting flatter faster than it should.

AMERICA.  Build that tolerance, baby.  Are you ready?

DANIEL.  Going again?

AMERICA.  Going again.

DANIEL.  Are you ready already?

AMERICA.  Yeah, I think I am.

DANIEL.  Stuff wears off quick.

AMERICA.  It does these days.  Will you mix mine for me?

DANIEL.  Gimme that.  What happened to this thing?

AMERICA.  What are you talking about?

DANIEL.  This thing is flat.

AMERICA.  You're gonna handle the mixing this time.

DANIEL.  It's only been thirty minutes.

AMERICA.  It was longer than that.

DANIEL.  I looked at the clock.

AMERICA.  It'll take you five minutes to mix it.  We'll be ready by then.

DANIEL.  Hold this.  Geez.

AMERICA.  What?

DANIEL.  Just wanna lie down.

AMERICA.  I'll mix.

DANIEL.  No.  Wait one second.

AMERICA.  I kinda can't.

DANIEL.  Grief.

AMERICA.  What?

DANIEL.  You're a fiend.

AMERICA.  I'm a fiend for shots, you're a fiend for pussy.

DANIEL.  We both fiend shots.

AMERICA.  Does that mean I also have to fiend for pussy?

DANIEL.  No, the shots belong to me.

AMERICA.  The pussy, on the other hand \ldots

DANIEL.  The pussy on the other hand?

AMERICA.  You want to fuck while we do it?

DANIEL.  Get me hard.

AMERICA.  I'm just gonna sit on you this time.

\emph{She sits on him.}

DANIEL.  Are you gonna mix that?

AMERICA.  Yeah.

DANIEL.  Good.

\emph{She mixes two shots on her desk.  He can't see because he's lying on the floor.}

DANIEL.  Give us a bigger one than last time.

AMERICA.  I know.

DANIEL.  Not too much more.

AMERICA.  I know how much to give us.

DANIEL.  Are you gonna shoot yourself?

AMERICA.  I'm gonna shoot us both.

DANIEL.  You're gonna do me first?

AMERICA.  Yes.

DANIEL.  How much more are you giving?

AMERICA.  A good amount.

DANIEL.  How much is left?  Just split the bag.

AMERICA.  I did.

DANIEL.  Good girl.  What time is it.

AMERICA.  Two minutes after the last time you asked me.

DANIEL.  We need to wait a little longer.

AMERICA.  There's no way.

DANIEL.  Just ten minutes.

AMERICA.  Ten minutes isn't gonna make any difference.  We'll be fine.

DANIEL.  I don't know.

AMERICA.  Even if I said yes you wouldn't wait ten minutes.

DANIEL.  No?

AMERICA.  You'd wait five.

DANIEL.  How's that coming?

AMERICA.  Done.

\emph{She kneels over him with his shot.  He gets his arm ready.}

AMERICA.  Some people are drug addicts, some people are love addicts.

\emph{She puts the needle in.}

DANIEL.  What if you fall in love with a love addict?

\emph{She shoots him.}

AMERICA.  Trick or treat.

AMERICA.  Here's something.

DANIEL.  That's nothing!

AMERICA.  Yes!

DANIEL.  No, you can't use that.

AMERICA.  Why.

DANIEL.  It'll kill you.

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  What.

DANIEL.  This might be---

AMERICA.  What is it?

DANIEL.  Hold this.

AMERICA.  What is it.

DANIEL.  Open it.  Get two out.

AMERICA.  This better be something.

DANIEL.  By itself it's nothing.

AMERICA.  What do you mix it with?

DANIEL.  Something that's so much like itself, it explodes.

AMERICA.  You've done it before?

DANIEL.  Well, not really explodes, but---

AMERICA.  What is it?

DANIEL.  It's a crazy reaction.

AMERICA.  Is it good?

DANIEL.  Pff.

AMERICA.  Yeah?

DANIEL.  Crush those.

AMERICA.  Fine.

DANIEL.  And you need to produce the reagent.

AMERICA.  How?

DANIEL.  How do you think?  A cyclic reagent and its pair \ldots

AMERICA.  That's like us.

DANIEL.  Which one are you?

AMERICA.  You're the cyclic reagent, I'm the pair.  What's that part?

DANIEL.  Ammonia.

AMERICA.  What's that part?

DANIEL.  Magnesium.

AMERICA.  This better get me fucking high.

DANIEL.  And if it doesn't?

AMERICA.  Don't play with me.

DANIEL.  No not that.

AMERICA.  This?

DANIEL.  Yes.

AMERICA.  Oh.

DANIEL.  That would have been a short trip.  Give me that.

\emph{She holds it tight, then gives it to him.  He tosses it in the trash.}

DANIEL.  Not in a long time.

AMERICA.  When you were my age?

DANIEL.  Even younger.

AMERICA.  Why'd you quit?

DANIEL.  Got married.

AMERICA.  Oooh!

DANIEL.  Not to her.

AMERICA.  I don't care, I like hearing about your wives.

DANIEL.  That's sick.

AMERICA.  Here.

DANIEL.  Got it?

AMERICA.  Yeah, it's done.

DANIEL.  Get a flame.  And one of those.

AMERICA.  Please, professor, use proper names.

DANIEL.  You forget \ldots

AMERICA.  Otherwise how will I learn my vocabulary?

DANIEL.  You forget that I am no longer a professor.

AMERICA.  Mmm, I like that.  Now we can do anything we want.

DANIEL.  Cept I don't have a job.

AMERICA.  I'll whore myself out on the street.

AMERICA.  Fine, we'll whore you out.

DANIEL.  Much better.  Turn that up.

AMERICA.  Here?

DANIEL.  Higher.  Stop.

AMERICA.  I like it when you boss me around.

DANIEL.  Would you stop with that?

AMERICA.  Seriously?

DANIEL.  Keep heating.

AMERICA.  Who's the fiend now?  Fuck you!

DANIEL.  Heat it ten more seconds.

AMERICA.  I really hate your moods.

DANIEL.  Sorry.

AMERICA.  You need to be nice to me, and at all times.

DANIEL.  Look at you though, earlier \ldots screaming until we found a solution.

AMERICA.  I wasn't scream---

DANIEL.  Stop, take it off the heat!

AMERICA.  Here.

DANIEL.  Careful!

AMERICA.  Sorry!  Did I mess it up?

DANIEL.  No, you're fine.  Get yourself comfortable.

AMERICA.  It's almost there?

DANIEL.  Almost.

\emph{She lifts herself onto the counter.}

DANIEL.  Excited?

AMERICA.  I love to try new things.

DANIEL.  This qualifies.

AMERICA.  I'll be the judge of that.

DANIEL.  Give me your arm.

DANIEL.  Scared?

AMERICA.  A little.

AMERICA.  Jesus fucking god.

DANIEL.  She's been up and down.

MARY.  She said she's happy with you.  She said she really likes you.

DANIEL.  She means the world to me.

MARY.  Oh, America, why are so so stupid?  Sometimes you're so stupid.

DANIEL.  We've both been stupid.  I really wish---

MARY.  This isn't the start of this for her, you know that.

DANIEL.  I never ever meant for anything bad to happen to her.

MARY.  She's been in trouble since before this.  She's had such a hard time.

DANIEL.  There's no excuse for what I did.

MARY.  You know this isn't the start of this for her.  For many years, she's been---

DANIEL.  I shouldn't have acted the way I did with her.

MARY.  She's never learned to take care of herself.  Which is my fault.

DANIEL.  No.

MARY.  If she didn't learn that better by her age, that's me.

DANIEL.  No.

MARY.  That's all me.  Yes.  Yes, it is.  You know she's been to A.A.?

DANIEL.  Yeah, she said.

MARY.  That's not all she's been to.  You know she took a year off school?

DANIEL.  When?

MARY.  Before this year.  This has been going on with her since she was fourteen.

DANIEL.  She told me some things, but \ldots

MARY.  Not this exact thing.  No doubt you two have encouraged each other.

DANIEL.  I'm so sorry.

MARY.  But this kind of thing.  She's so reckless.  You have to wonder, as a mother---

DANIEL.  She loves you very much.

MARY.  You know I used to drink?  When she was little.

\emph{The weight of it all, not just this last fact, hitting him.}

DANIEL.  Oh, god.

MARY.  I think it affected her most of the three of them.

\emph{She breaks up.}

MARY.  Do you have children?

DANIEL.  Yes.

MARY.  So you know, you blame yourself.

DANIEL.  You don't have to blame yourself for this.

MARY.  Oh, I don't know.

DANIEL.  I was a huge part of this.

MARY.  No.

DANIEL.  Who gave her the shit?

MARY.  She wanted that anyway.

DANIEL.  I don't think you understand the specifics of what we were doing.

MARY.  I've talked with her friends.  She was doing it with them too.

DANIEL.  I don't think she was doing exactly the level of stuff that we did.

MARY.  You don't think I went through an experimentation phase in college?

DANIEL.  I wouldn't expect you to ever forgive me.

MARY.  She liked you.  I'm glad she was with you.

\emph{He breaks up.}

DANIEL.  She's so special.

MARY.  Do you know what she told her sister?  She said \ldots

DANIEL.  I don't expect you to ever forgive me for this.

MARY.  She's been writing her sister letters about you.

DANIEL.  She has?

MARY.  We get one in the mailbox about every two days.

DANIEL.  Ohh.

MARY.  Has she told you how she feels about you?

DANIEL.  You should hate me.  You should want me dead.

MARY.  Are you suicidal?

DANIEL.  Yeah.

MARY.  I am too.  But I'm not gonna do that.  For her.

DANIEL.  I know.

MARY.  You know she really loves you.

DANIEL.  I love her more than anyone I've met.

MARY.  She's in love with you.  She said that.

\emph{Daniel exhales vocally.}

MARY.  She said so in her letters.  To her sister.  She's told us many times.

DANIEL.  You should want me dead.

MARY.  Has she ever told you?

DANIEL.  We've never said that to each other.

MARY.  You should have.

DANIEL.  I know.  I'm sorry.

MARY.  You both should have.

DANIEL.  I'm so sorry this happened.

MARY.  I think she really may have done it to herself this time.

DANIEL.  Do you want me to go?

MARY.  No, I want you to be here, it's good for me.

DANIEL.  I don't see how that is.

MARY.  It feels good to be around someone she was close to.

DANIEL.  She's gonna be okay.  I know she's gonna be okay.

MARY.  I don't know.

DANIEL.  What's the last thing they're saying?

MARY.  They don't know.  Are you hungry?

DANIEL.  No.

MARY.  I am.  Come down with me and get some fries.

DANIEL.  Okay.

MARY.  No.  I can't walk right now.  How's she doing in school?

DANIEL.  She's doing great in my---  She's doing fine.

MARY.  That's what I meant.  How's she doing in your class?

DANIEL.  She's phenomenal.

MARY.  I know.  She always has been smart.  I hear your class is hard, too.

DANIEL.  She scores perfect on every test.

MARY.  She's good at memorizing.

DANIEL.  Yes, but it's more than that.

MARY.  She used to recite television commercials to us at dinnertime.

DANIEL.  She did?

MARY.  I mean every single commercial she knew.  It was cute the first day.

DANIEL.  She doesn't even watch T.V.  now.

MARY.  I think she got tired of having commercials stuck in her head.

DANIEL.  But she used to recite them?

MARY.  It was annoying, trust me.  Does she ever do stuff like that to you?

DANIEL.  Like what?

MARY.  Hound you with something until you have to give in.

DANIEL.  Well \ldots

MARY.  No?

DANIEL.  Maybe.

MARY.  Maybe she's mellowing in her old age.  I hope she makes it out of this.

DANIEL.  Do you want to be alone?

MARY.  No.  Walk me, let's get a sandwich.

AMERICA.  \emph{(under her breath)} I'm always hurting.

\emph{He comes back.}

DANIEL.  What hurts?

AMERICA.  My head.  Give me two.

DANIEL.  Like a headache?

AMERICA.  Like a very bad headache, yes.

\emph{He gives her two.  She takes them with a tiny bit of water.}

DANIEL.  Drink some more.

AMERICA.  I'm fine.

DANIEL.  You don't want to fuck up your stomach.

AMERICA.  My stomach's fucked, baby, who gives a shit.

DANIEL.  It is not.  Drink some more.

AMERICA.  Lay off!

DANIEL.  You want juice?

AMERICA.  Forget it.

DANIEL.  I'll bring you juice.

AMERICA.  Back to bed, no juice.  Back to bed, lights out.  What are you doing?

DANIEL.  Putting this away.

AMERICA.  Leave it, save yourself a trip.  You know what you need to do?

DANIEL.  What.

\emph{He sets the Vicodin down.}

AMERICA.  Mix me some of that good shit.

\emph{She picks the Vicodin up and shakes out a few more.}

DANIEL.  Please don't say that.

AMERICA.  I'm serious, what is this bullshit?!

\emph{She throws the open Vicodin bottle across the room, pills scatter.}

AMERICA.  I know you've got the stuff somewhere.

DANIEL.  I don't.

AMERICA.  You've got it in the basement.

DANIEL.  I don't have it anywhere.

AMERICA.  Get it then.

DANIEL.  Your mom would kill me.

AMERICA.  What the fuck is that?  My mom??  Do you see my mom anywhere?

DANIEL.  You should have seen her.

AMERICA.  My mom doesn't give a shit about me.  She never has.

DANIEL.  She does.

AMERICA.  My mom doesn't even know me.  Neither do you by the way.

DANIEL.  She's trying to.

AMERICA.  If you mention her again---  Don't you fucking mention her again.

DANIEL.  Let's sleep.

AMERICA.  That's what I just said.  Bring me one of those.

DANIEL.  You've had enough.

AMERICA.  My head \ldots

\emph{She laughs insanely.}

AMERICA.  My head hurts.

DANIEL.  Wait twenty minutes.

AMERICA.  Six of these isn't gonna do shit to me.  I need another one.  Please.

\emph{He brings her one more.}

AMERICA.  What a ripoff.

\emph{He gets in bed, turns out the light.}

AMERICA.  What you need to do---

DANIEL.  What?

AMERICA.  Mix me some of that good shit.

DANIEL.  Stop saying that.

\emph{She's laughing.}

AMERICA.  That would be great wouldn't it, if we had some of that.  Just a little \ldots

DANIEL.  I think maybe you should go back with your mom.

AMERICA.  I'm not sure if you heard me from before, but she hates me.

DANIEL.  You know that isn't true.

AMERICA.  Hates me.

DANIEL.  She doesn't---

AMERICA.  Absolutely hates me.  Has since birth.

DANIEL.  She sounds worried.

AMERICA.  She's just acting like she is, she feels like she has to!

DANIEL.  I think she is really very worried about you.

AMERICA.  You're just trying to get rid of me.

DANIEL.  I'm not---

AMERICA.  Also, stop talking to my mother.

DANIEL.  I think you should call her.

AMERICA.  I will call her, when I'm dead.

DANIEL.  What's wrong?

AMERICA.  Everything's perfect.

DANIEL.  Talk to me.

AMERICA.  Perfect.

DANIEL.  I'm going to bed.

AMERICA.  No.

DANIEL.  What does that mean, no.

AMERICA.  It means you're not going to bed.

DANIEL.  Why is that?

AMERICA.  Because I don't want you to.

\emph{She crawls over him and flips on the light.  They stare at each other with animosity.}

\section*{Scene 21.  Their bedroom - Night}

\emph{She's sleeping alone, he comes in.}

DANIEL.  How is it?

AMERICA.  It's really bad.

DANIEL.  I'm sorry baby.  I brought you something.

AMERICA.  Did you?  Oh, you're so nice.  Did you really.

DANIEL.  How bad is it?

AMERICA.  It really has been bad today.

DANIEL.  I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry this happened to you.

AMERICA.  It's not your fault.  Will you mix it for me.

DANIEL.  Of course I'm gonna mix it for you.

AMERICA.  Where'd you get the stuff?

DANIEL.  I bought it off the Internet.

AMERICA.  You bought it yourself?

DANIEL.  Yeah, I bought it.

AMERICA.  How much was this?

DANIEL.  It was a lot.

AMERICA.  How much did you get?

DANIEL.  I want you to go slow with this, this time.

AMERICA.  I'm no good at going slow.

DANIEL.  I know, but \ldots

AMERICA.  I'll try.

DANIEL.  I need you to.

AMERICA.  I will.

DANIEL.  For me---

AMERICA.  I know, I will.  I'm sorry.

DANIEL.  There's nothing for you to be sorry about.

AMERICA.  I actually don't want to do this.

DANIEL.  Then don't.  Do you know how happy that would make me?

AMERICA.  Do it with me.

DANIEL.  Okay.

AMERICA.  You will?

DANIEL.  I hate seeing you like this.

AMERICA.  I'm fine.  You'll be with me?

DANIEL.  Yes.

AMERICA.  Baby.  Thank you.

DANIEL.  Please don't thank me.

AMERICA.  You're gonna love it.  God, it's like nothing else.

DANIEL.  I know.

AMERICA.  But let's do a little less this time.

DANIEL.  Jesus.

AMERICA.  Mix it.

\emph{He nods.  He mixes it.}

AMERICA.  You really don't want me to do this?

DANIEL.  I really don't.

AMERICA.  But you still bought it for me, because I want it?

DANIEL.  What can I do?

AMERICA.  That says something great about you.

DANIEL.  I wish we didn't have to be saying something great.

AMERICA.  But it does.

DANIEL.  I wish we could just be happy.  In a simple way this time.

AMERICA.  We are happy.  Be happy with me.

DANIEL.  It's risking your life, every time you do it.

AMERICA.  Risk with me.

DANIEL.  I want to!  I want nothing more!  I wish I had your pain!

AMERICA.  You're close to me without my pain, you have always been a part of me.

DANIEL.  Can I talk you out of this?

AMERICA.  You don't know how bad this is.

DANIEL.  I'm so sorry.

AMERICA.  What they give me doesn't even help.

DANIEL.  It helps some though doesn't it?

AMERICA.  What they give me is nothing, compared to this.

DANIEL.  What they give you is safer.

AMERICA.  You know that isn't true, statistically speaking.

DANIEL.  You are my best student.

AMERICA.  I just had a bad run.

DANIEL.  I know.

AMERICA.  It's just luck.  Get in a car, plug in a hairdryer, go swimming.

DANIEL.  Sharks?

AMERICA.  Drowning.  Whatever.  You can die from taking Aspirin.

DANIEL.  This is so much more dramatic.

AMERICA.  You think dying in a car accident isn't dramatic?  I bet it is.

DANIEL.  You don't have to do this, though.  You have to drive.

AMERICA.  We could all stop driving if we wanted to.

DANIEL.  That would be a lot harder than everyone stopping doing drugs.

AMERICA.  Not if you include prescription drugs and alcohol.

DANIEL.  Then let's just do a Prozac and a beer!

AMERICA.  No chance.

DANIEL.  None?

AMERICA.  Not after you put that in my face.

DANIEL.  I shouldn't have.

AMERICA.  I'm glad you did.

DANIEL.  I'm not.

AMERICA.  I'm really glad you did.  Thank you.  Thank you, this is gonna help me.

DANIEL.  We're doing a smaller amount this time.

AMERICA.  Yes.

DANIEL.  A much smaller amount.

AMERICA.  Okay, but not too small.

DANIEL.  Grief, woman.

AMERICA.  Is it mixed?

DANIEL.  Yeah.

AMERICA.  Let me see the size.

DANIEL.  Do you want less?

AMERICA.  No.  Anyway what about skydiving?

DANIEL.  What about it?

AMERICA.  It's extremely dangerous, but no one thinks bad of you for doing it.

DANIEL.  I'm'onna have to get back to you on that one.

AMERICA.  It's a totally optional activity.  Are you gonna do me first?

DANIEL.  You're first.

AMERICA.  Then you?

DANIEL.  Then me.

\emph{They have a long look.}

AMERICA.  Do it.

\emph{He hits her slowly.}

DANIEL.  Is this okay?

AMERICA.  Yes.

DANIEL.  Still okay?

AMERICA.  Do the rest of it.

DANIEL.  You feel it?

AMERICA.  Yeah.  Enhh.  There it is.

DANIEL.  You with me?

AMERICA.  Mmm.

\emph{She lies back.  Daniel puts the syringe down and lies beside her.}

AMERICA.  Are you doing it now?

DANIEL.  Yeah.

AMERICA.  Did you do it yet?

DANIEL.  I did it.

\section*{Scene 22.  Their bedroom}

\emph{She's in bed, he comes in.  He sets a new batch of chemicals on the bedside table.}

AMERICA.  Shoot me up.

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  Stay.

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  Stay for a minute.

DANIEL.  I can't.

AMERICA.  Sure you can.

DANIEL.  I can't watch you---

AMERICA.  Don't, then.  Close your eyes.

DANIEL.  Don't do it.

AMERICA.  I'll wait till you're gone.

DANIEL.  Don't do it.

\emph{She mixes.}

AMERICA.  I'm in a good run now.

DANIEL.  What if I said you're hurting me?

AMERICA.  Look, I'm getting better.

\emph{She raises one leg.}

DANIEL.  That's wonderful!

AMERICA.  Wanna see the other one?

DANIEL.  Yes.  Wow.  When did this happen?

AMERICA.  Today.

DANIEL.  That's amazing.

AMERICA.  I know, aren't you proud of me?

DANIEL.  How's your pain?

AMERICA.  Better.  Somewhat.

DANIEL.  Then---

AMERICA.  Not all better.

DANIEL.  America, then, stop with this shit.

\emph{He puts a hand on hers, she stops mixing.}

DANIEL.  You don't need it.

AMERICA.  Just one more.

\emph{His hand falls off as she goes back to mixing.}

AMERICA.  Don't say it.

DANIEL.  It's always just one more.

AMERICA.  I told you not to say it.

DANIEL.  Please.  Please, you can move.  Doesn't that make you happy?

AMERICA.  I'm happy all over.

DANIEL.  Good.  Good, then stop.

AMERICA.  You brought it to me.

DANIEL.  I thought you needed it.

AMERICA.  I do need it, just not where you think.  I want you to fuck me.

DANIEL.  Can you?

AMERICA.  Yes I can.

DANIEL.  That's wonderful.

AMERICA.  No, it's not wonderful, you sound like my doctor, geez.

DANIEL.  I'm sorry.

AMERICA.  Put your tongue in me while I go.

DANIEL.  I'll put my tongue in you.

AMERICA.  Go with this time.

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  You can't say no.

DANIEL.  I will put my tongue in you.

AMERICA.  You can't say no!

DANIEL.  Let's make love, since we can.  Isn't that enough for today?

AMERICA.  We will.  We will, we'll make love.

DANIEL.  That's all I want.

AMERICA.  We'll make love all day.

DANIEL.  Good.

AMERICA.  You'll have to do most of the work.

DANIEL.  I'll do all of it.

AMERICA.  Where's the fun in that?

DANIEL.  Oh yeah, what are you gonna do for me?

AMERICA.  I'm gonna suck you off while you shoot.

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  Fine, I'll just put my mouth on it then.

DANIEL.  I'm not gonna shoot.

AMERICA.  Come on.

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  Come on.

DANIEL.  No, really, stop.  I'm not gonna shoot.  You go ahead if you have to.

AMERICA.  I don't have to.  I want to.

DANIEL.  Go ahead.

AMERICA.  I want to do it with you.

DANIEL.  I'll be with you.

AMERICA.  I want you to do it with me.

DANIEL.  I can't.

AMERICA.  Why.

DANIEL.  It's too scary.

AMERICA.  I know it is.

DANIEL.  I can't afford to be that scared anymore.

AMERICA.  Just do it with me this time.  Then we'll go for a walk.

DANIEL.  Could you?

AMERICA.  No.  But we could go for a drive.

DANIEL.  Let's do that.

AMERICA.  We will.

DANIEL.  Let's do it now.

AMERICA.  Can I shoot in the car?

DANIEL.  No.

AMERICA.  Why?

DANIEL.  You'll get arrested!

AMERICA.  Shoot me in the car.

DANIEL.  I'm not doing that.

AMERICA.  Then shoot me here.

DANIEL.  Shoot yourself.

AMERICA.  I'm gonna do this one way or the other.  You might as well help.

DANIEL.  I'm thinking differently on that now.

AMERICA.  Fine.  I'll do it.

DANIEL.  Please listen to me.

AMERICA.  I'm listening.

DANIEL.  I have something to ask you.

AMERICA.  Shoot.  Get it?

DANIEL.  I get it.

AMERICA.  Hit me and then ask your question.

DANIEL.  I can't.

AMERICA.  Why.

DANIEL.  Because of my question.

\emph{She's about to shoot herself.}

AMERICA.  Which is?

DANIEL.  Will you stop with that?

AMERICA.  Ask your question.

DANIEL.  That is my question.  Will you stop?

AMERICA.  Will I stop \ldots this?

DANIEL.  Will you stop.  Doing that.  Will you stop doing it forever.

AMERICA.  Why don't you stop bringing it to me?

DANIEL.  Because you want it \ldots

AMERICA.  I love you for that.

DANIEL.  \ldots and I would do anything you asked.

AMERICA.  I'm mixing you a shot.

DANIEL.  Don't.

AMERICA.  You need one.  I know you want to too.  You can use me for an excuse.

DANIEL.  It's so nice today.  It's a perfect day for a drive.

AMERICA.  Wanna see me move my legs again?

DANIEL.  Yes.  Go.  Doesn't that feel good?

AMERICA.  It feels wonderful.  So will this, don't try to be sneaky.

DANIEL.  Walk with me around the room.

AMERICA.  Don't try to be sneaky.

DANIEL.  How long since you've walked?

AMERICA.  Walking is overrated.

DANIEL.  No it isn't.

AMERICA.  Fuck you!  I was joking.  You want to make me feel bad?

DANIEL.  I'm sorry.

AMERICA.  I never made you stop.  Have you thought of that?

DANIEL.  Stop with what?  Sex?

AMERICA.  Maybe sex.  Maybe this.

DANIEL.  I think you wanted the sex part.

AMERICA.  Maybe I wanted sex and to split an ecstasy pill with you, not this shit.

DANIEL.  It wasn't this to start with.

AMERICA.  Don't be technical.  Maybe I never wanted to stick my arm!

DANIEL.  You shouldn't have let me.

AMERICA.  I wanted to let you.  I wanted to do whatever you wanted us to do.  Together.

DANIEL.  Tell me at least you wanted the sex.  You did invite me to lunch.

AMERICA.  Oh, baby, I want sex with you right now, I always wanted the sex.

DANIEL.  This shit is no way to live your life, believe me.

AMERICA.  You're doing fine.

DANIEL.  No, I'm not.  It might seem that way to you but I'm not.

AMERICA.  You can get another job.

DANIEL.  I shoulda stopped this shit a long time ago.

AMERICA.  You lived through it.

DANIEL.  You almost didn't.

AMERICA.  But I did.

DANIEL.  That would have been the end of my life.

AMERICA.  But it wasn't.

DANIEL.  I would have never gotten over that.

AMERICA.  Lucky for you, you didn't have to.

\emph{She hands him a syringe and picks hers up off the table.}

AMERICA.  Here we are.

DANIEL.  Yes, here we are.

\emph{He puts down the syringe.}

DANIEL.  I'm going for a drive.

AMERICA.  I'll meet you.

DANIEL.  I'll be in the car.

AMERICA.  Good.

DANIEL.  I'm only waiting five minutes.

AMERICA.  I'll see you there.

DANIEL.  I have nothing else to say.

AMERICA.  When you have nothing left to say, say nothing.

\emph{He leaves.  She shoots herself up.  With the energy it gives her, she gets out of bed and stands.  She slides back onto the bed in her high.  She takes the other syringe.  She fiddles with it.  She looks away, thinking of Daniel.  Then she preps her arm and shoots it.}

\section*{Scene 23.  Daniel's bedroom}

\emph{All the furniture is gone, drapes, everything.  Daniel stands at a window, staring out.  He is holding America's paperweight.  He strikes the window, turns.  He throws the paperweight, it smashes, water and snow spilled on the floor.}

\section*{Scene 24.  It snows on Daniel}

DANIEL.  I saw this woman today.  She was like you but \ldots she was maybe forty-five, fifty, somewhere in there.  And \ldots  You know how time has a tendency to wear us down?  This woman \ldots it was like she had somehow resisted that.  Some people, even when they smile, there's this \ldots sadness in their eyes.  But then there's this rare example, every ten-thousand people you cross paths with, who have \ldots a spark \ldots of some sort \ldots an elegance, an ease about them.  I used to think only some people had it, but now I think that everyone is born with that spark.  What's rare is to find someone who over all those years would never let it be taken away.

\emph{America is there.}

AMERICA.  Keep talking.

\emph{America is there with him, walking in the snow.}

DANIEL.  What about?

AMERICA.  Anything you want.

DANIEL.  Do you have any regrets?

AMERICA.  I'm too young to have regrets.

DANIEL.  Even an eight-year-old has regrets.

AMERICA.  Like, I wish I hadn't traded my P.B.J.  for that cupcake?

DANIEL.  I'm sure there's something you wish you hadn't done.

AMERICA.  Yeah, there is.

DANIEL.  You don't have to tell me.

AMERICA.  This wasn't something recent.

DANIEL.  No?

AMERICA.  This was long ago, in college.

DANIEL.  Wha'd you miss?

AMERICA.  A kiss.

DANIEL.  Describe it for me.

AMERICA.  There was this guy.  I should have kissed him, but \ldots I didn't.

DANIEL.  Why didn't you?

AMERICA.  I was scared.

DANIEL.  You should have kissed him anyway.

AMERICA.  I know.

DANIEL.  And, since then, have you made that same mistake?

AMERICA.  No I haven't.

\emph{She kisses Daniel.}

\section*{Scene 25.  Daniel's office}

\emph{Daniel and the dean come in together.  The place is cleaned out except the furniture.}

DANIEL.  Is that a concern?

DEAN.  Somewhat.

DANIEL.  How much of a concern is it?

DEAN.  It's somewhat of a concern.  I can't measure the precise quantity.

DANIEL.  What's been the impact on our reputation?

DEAN.  Oh, this is something you concern yourself with now, reputation?

DANIEL.  No, I was just asking to be polite.

DEAN.  I'll handle the reputations thanks.  Although \ldots

DANIEL.  Have I made things difficult for you?

DEAN.  You could help me out a little.

DANIEL.  When do I get my keys?

DEAN.  You get them now.

DANIEL.  Thank you.

DEAN.  Although \ldots

DANIEL.  They feel a bit lighter.

DEAN.  \ldots you'll notice there's one missing.

DANIEL.  I didn't need a key before.

DEAN.  Please don't.

DANIEL.  I won't.  I promise.

DEAN.  That would be the end.

DANIEL.  How'd you handle the press on that one?

DEAN.  There wasn't any press, that's how I handled it.

DANIEL.  Thanks.

DEAN.  Reputation is my department.

DANIEL.  I'm glad to be back in mine.

DEAN.  I don't doubt it.

DANIEL.  Thank you.

DEAN.  Just remember how glad you are to be back and we'll be fine.

DANIEL.  I will.

DEAN.  If you need help, ever, tell me.

DANIEL.  Can you have my books shipped over from the house?

DEAN.  How bout you ship them this time.

DANIEL.  Fine.

DEAN.  You know how dear you are to me.

DANIEL.  I didn't know that.

DEAN.  You are.

DANIEL.  Is that why I'm back?

DEAN.  No.

DANIEL.  No?

DEAN.  You're back cause I can't find anyone else.

DANIEL.  Please, less honesty.

DEAN.  You're a wonderful teacher.

DANIEL.  And the students love me.

DEAN.  You are quite the charmer.

DANIEL.  I know, and it's inappropriate \ldots

DEAN.  Well \ldots

DANIEL.  It won't happen again.

DEAN.  Well \ldots

DANIEL.  It's just, with this one \ldots

DEAN.  You loved her, didn't you?

DANIEL.  Yes.

DEAN.  I wish she was still with you.

DANIEL.  No.  It was wrong of me in the first place.

DEAN.  Oh, I don't know.  She loved you too I think.

DANIEL.  I hope so.

DEAN.  Think of Pythagoras.

DANIEL.  Oh?

DEAN.  Come on.  You think I'm gonna tell you not to bang your students?

DANIEL.  Are you?

DEAN.  It's an ancient tradition of the academic world!

DANIEL.  Do you bang the students?

DEAN.  It's harder for a dean.  But I would if they were coming onto me.

DANIEL.  I could send some your way.

DEAN.  No.

DANIEL.  I'll send you all of mine.

DEAN.  No.

DANIEL.  Every other girl that walks in that door.

DEAN.  That's the problem.

DANIEL.  What?

DEAN.  Every other girl.

DANIEL.  Oh.

DEAN.  So you see.

DANIEL.  Really?

DEAN.  Yes.

DANIEL.  I can't help you there.

DEAN.  Didn't think you could.

\emph{The dean nods, smiles, and gets up.}

DEAN.  That's between us.

DANIEL.  Figured.

DEAN.  Reputations and all.

DANIEL.  Of course.

\emph{The dean leaves.  Daniel settles into his office.  He sits in his chair, leans back.  Something on a top shelf catches his eye.  He gets up, climbs on the counter to get it.  It's a tourniquet.  He takes it down, wraps it around his hand.  Then he puts it in the trash and leaves.}

\section*{Scene 26.  At the bar}

\emph{They're playing pool (or darts).}

SANDRO.  You've lost your touch.

DANIEL.  I don't think so.

SANDRO.  You play better when your mind is less occupied, that's the problem.

DANIEL.  I'm sorry I just disappeared.

SANDRO.  Don't worry about it.

DANIEL.  It's like I'm not a human when I'm on drugs.

SANDRO.  Understood.

DANIEL.  I'm sorry I said \ldots whatever I said to you.

SANDRO.  Now that apology I will accept.

DANIEL.  What did I say?

SANDRO.  Hmmm.

DANIEL.  I'm just kidding.  Don't tell me.

SANDRO.  I have forgotten anyway, my memory is too bad.

DANIEL.  Your memory is fine.

SANDRO.  I remember you being better at pool, so I think there is a problem.

DANIEL.  You've been practicing.

SANDRO.  Of course.  Every Thursday I come here.  And I think, where is my friend?

DANIEL.  I'm sorry.

SANDRO.  But every week, you are not here.  So?  I still play.

DANIEL.  Next week I'm gonna kick your ass.

SANDRO.  Not at this rate.

DANIEL.  She used to play pool with her friends.

SANDRO.  You went with her?

DANIEL.  No.  She invited me once but I didn't \ldots

SANDRO.  It's probably better.

DANIEL.  \ldots I didn't go.

SANDRO.  I am sorry for what happened.  If you don't want to talk about it---

DANIEL.  I brought it up.  Maybe next week.

SANDRO.  Get a drink.

DANIEL.  That's okay.

SANDRO.  It's on me.

DANIEL.  No thanks.

SANDRO.  Have a beer.

DANIEL.  No.

SANDRO.  A scotch.

DANIEL.  I'm fine.

SANDRO.  Something you need to understand, my friend \ldots

DANIEL.  What?

SANDRO.  \ldots the importance, for former drug addicts, of being an alcoholic.

DANIEL.  Jesus.

SANDRO.  You have stolen my word.

DANIEL.  I'm just borrowing it.

SANDRO.  That is so not cool.

DANIEL.  Is it my turn?

SANDRO.  You would like that, wouldn't you.

DANIEL.  Just another chance to miss.

SANDRO.  Another chance to win.

DANIEL.  I'm too far down.

SANDRO.  Make one run.

DANIEL.  Yeah, okay.

SANDRO.  One run is all you need.  One turn, and you win the game.

DANIEL.  Easy for you, edge master.  How do you always make those shots?

SANDRO.  I don't always make them.

DANIEL.  Yes, you always to.

SANDRO.  Not always.

DANIEL.  Yes you do.

\emph{Sandro takes a shot, he intentionally hits the ball way off.}

SANDRO.  See?  You are wrong, my friend.

\section*{Scene 27.  Daniel's office, fully furnished}

\emph{Daniel is already there.  A student comes by tentatively.}

DANIEL.  Come in.

LACY.  I'm from your class.

DANIEL.  Yes, I recognize you.  Miss Brothers.  C average.

LACY.  Lacy.

DANIEL.  Lacy Brothers.  Always sits in the back of the class.

LACY.  Gives a better overall vantage point on the room.

DANIEL.  You sit in the same seat every single week.

\emph{She smiles.}

DANIEL.  Why is that?

LACY.  Once you find something you like you should keep it.

DANIEL.  Even a chair?

LACY.  I like my chair.  It has graffiti I like, and gum.

DANIEL.  What does it say?

LACY.  It says the dean sucks cock.

DANIEL.  And what do you think?

LACY.  I don't know the dean.

DANIEL.  But I do.

LACY.  And?

DANIEL.  People write all sorts of things.  Who knows if any of it means anything.

LACY.  Look, I came here for a reason, so \ldots I \ldots

DANIEL.  You're not happy with your C---

LACY.  I don't care about the C.

\emph{She kisses him, a peck, then pulls back, trying to judge his reaction.}

LACY.  I'm sorry.  It was a mistake to come here.

\emph{She goes.}

DANIEL.  I don't believe it's possible, not to make mistakes.

LACY.  You don't.

DANIEL.  The key for me, is \ldots

LACY.  What?

DANIEL.  Making the right ones.

\emph{He goes for her.}
