BEFORE.  Hey \ldots

AGAIN.  Hey!  What's up?

BEFORE.  Nothin much.  What about you?

AGAIN.  Ehhh \ldots great!  The writing's \ldots

BEFORE \& AGAIN.  Flowing.

AGAIN.  Like a river.

BEFORE \& AGAIN.  Like the nile.

AGAIN.  Yes!  You and I are the only people I know with enough rapport to do that.

BEFORE.  Looks more like Niagara Falls.

AGAIN.  I know \ldots  We're like \ldots we have a conversation in which we say absolutely nothing \ldots I mean, nine yesses, two nos \ldots and the next day you show up with the apples, I bring the cherries \ldots

BEFORE.  And we make a fruit salad.

AGAIN.  Exactly.

BEFORE.  You know, if someone asked you to tell me what I'm thinking, I'd bet my life on you getting it right.

AGAIN.  And you'd live nine times out of ten.

BEFORE.  I would \ldots  What are you working on?

AGAIN.  Well, lately I've been working on this series of short stories that kind of go together to form a book \ldots well, see, they didn't start out to be a book \ldots I didn't even know I was writing a series \ldots I just wrote this short story and \ldots it just kind of grew.

BEFORE.  I know what you mean.

AGAIN.  It's funny how it happens like that.

BEFORE.  At least the good ones.

AGAIN.  Yeah.

BEFORE.  It's like there's some kind of thing with the subconscious \ldots once you let it open, all this stuff comes out that you didn't even know was there.

AGAIN.  It's kind of scary.

BEFORE.  Yeah, you don't want to let people in by accident.  Except, when you do \ldots  like when you show people your writing \ldots  they can \ldots  or they could \ldots  find out all this stuff about you \ldots  or they could just feel some sense of connection \ldots  some contract with the real \ldots  most people don't psychoanalyze you when they read your stuff anyway.

AGAIN.  It just goes in on their subconscious level.

BEFORE.  Yeah, most people don't think about it too much.

AGAIN.  No, they don't.

BEFORE.  I wonder if everybody thought about it, would it mess things up?

AGAIN.  Ehh \ldots

BEFORE.  Probably not.

AGAIN.  Because even if they did, some people would still think about it more than others.

BEFORE.  Yeah.

AGAIN.  Kind of like how things are now.

BEFORE.  We have this thing with possession.  \ldots  Like it makes us better than  everybody else.

AGAIN.  I don't follow.

BEFORE.  Where people think they're special because they have things that other people don't.  Or do things that other people don't.  Like this space of us thinking about deeply about people thinking deeply is the only one.

AGAIN.  Like we're the only ones who've ever had this discussion.

BEFORE.  And we aren't.

AGAIN.  No \ldots we're not \ldots  But we are \ldots  it doesn't happen every day.  Even for us.  We don't always talk like this.

BEFORE.  No \ldots so it's special for us \ldots within our relationship \ldots it's special for us regardless of who's talking philos outside this room \ldots

AGAIN.  \ldots outside this space \ldots

BEFORE.  \ldots outside this time \ldots this experience \ldots

AGAIN.  And we're the only ones who've ever had this exact conversation.

BEFORE.  Yes \ldots this experience of being us \ldots right here, right now \ldots that's completely ours.  No one's ever been us before, and no one will ever be us after.

AGAIN.  And even we've never been us before, the usses we are now \ldots  and after this moment \ldots

BEFORE.  \ldots that moment \ldots

AGAIN.  \ldots we'll never be the us we were before again.

BEFORE.  Deep.  Well \ldots?

AGAIN.  What's the call on the play?

BEFORE.  The play?

AGAIN.  Baseball!

BEFORE.  Okay \ldots it's deep into the bottom half of the second inning.  Samuel Oxford Lackadaisical Quinn steps up to the plate.

AGAIN.  Lackadaisical?

BEFORE.  Lack for short.

AGAIN.  Okay \ldots!?!

BEFORE.  He stomps the dirt like a bull in heat.  Paces madly over the plate.  Lackadaisically.

AGAIN.  And madly?!?

BEFORE.  Yes!  Yes!  \ldots Catching him off guard, the pitcher fires a runaway bullet into the sack.

AGAIN.  Owooo \ldots!

BEFORE.  But it misses good Sammy.

AGAIN.  Misses?

BEFORE.  Barely.

AGAIN.  Okay \ldots

BEFORE.  And it starts to rain.  And thunder.  And lightning!  \ldots  And \ldots they call off the game.

AGAIN.  Ehh \ldots too bad \ldots  I was having a good day.  If they had a let me in there \ldots sweet nilly, I would a done some harm.

BEFORE.  Oh no.

AGAIN.  Yes, brother \ldots I was standin on the plate \ldots lookin out over the sea of fans \ldots a breeding ground for the evils of sin and temptation!

BEFORE.  My, my.

AGAIN.  And I said to myself---

BEFORE.  Go on, now.

AGAIN.  I said---

BEFORE.  Preach it, brother Lack.

AGAIN.  I said Devil be gone!

BEFORE.  Oh yes!

AGAIN.  And the people \ldots they brooded!

BEFORE.  You know they do!

AGAIN.  They brooded!  And can you tell me what I did?

BEFORE.  Well yes I think I can now.

AGAIN.  I'm a gonna let you tell it, brother Dork.

BEFORE.  Thank you brother Lack.

AGAIN.  I'm not gonna say another word---

BEFORE.  Well thank the good Lord---

AGAIN.  Not gonna interrupt you one more time!

BEFORE.  No you're not---

AGAIN.  Not another---

BEFORE.  No, good brother Lack.  I know what you did next, though.  Standing in the middle of that cesspool \ldots no, the apex \ldots the paramount---

AGAIN.  Acme.

BEFORE.  Zenith.

AGAIN.  Epicenter!

BEFORE.  The epicenter of that cesspool of Satan's own vermin---

AGAIN.  Tell it now.

BEFORE.  You called upon the Lord.

AGAIN.  Yes \ldots

BEFORE.  You stared out into the crowd \ldots

AGAIN.  Uh huh \ldots

BEFORE.  Into the face of those power-hungry, greed-mongering sinners!  \ldots  And you picked up the microphone \ldots and you stared into the wide angle soft focus fifth-three millimeter lenses, and therefore into the homes, the private residences, of millions of unsuspecting Americans---

AGAIN.  And I said---

BEFORE.  Tell em what you said.

AGAIN.  I said \ldots put your hands on the TV set!  You will be saved!

BEFORE.  And don't forget to send your contributions to Televangelist I-N-C.

AGAIN.  You know, it's amazing what some people do for a living.

BEFORE.  Yeah \ldots When we grow up, we're gonna do good things.

AGAIN.  We're gonna do things that help people.

BEFORE.  We're gonna change the world.

AGAIN.  And we're not gonna be up the ass of some whiffy-spiffy CEO of some big company.

BEFORE.  No.

AGAIN.  We're not gonna work for anybody.

BEFORE.  \ldots We're gonna starve.

AGAIN.  Hey \ldots  I'd rather starve.

BEFORE.  Me too.

AGAIN.  Yes, my friend \ldots we'll grow up and starve together.

BEFORE.  All right!

AGAIN.  Well \ldots

BEFORE.  There's nobody I'd rather starve with.

AGAIN.  Thank you.  I would return the sentiment \ldots except that it's completely sick and disgusting.

BEFORE.  How fitting for the world we live in.

AGAIN.  So true.  \ldots  You know, we're the only people I know who'll go from, like, super-ecstatic to \ldots real deep and half-depressed in practically the same breath.

BEFORE.  Yeah.  \ldots  But I'm not depressed, are you?

AGAIN.  Oh, you mean aside from the fact that my mind is filled with about a million and one thoughts about death and growing up and the wicked, gradual loss of youth and innocence that occurs with all of that \ldots?  Yeah, I feel okay.

BEFORE.  Me too.  Not perfect.  Maybe not even good.  But okay.

AGAIN.  Okay \ldots

BEFORE.  Okay!

AGAIN.  Okay!

BEFORE.  All right!

AGAIN.  Yeah!

BEFORE.  Yes!

AGAIN.  Ooo \ldots ooo!

BEFORE.  Woo!

\section*{}

WOMAN.  \ldots the black people irritate the white people and the white people irritate the black people \ldots the white people are more generally depressed than the black people, but the black people are stronger than the white people \ldots if you sit around the house all the time being sad, being consumed with yourself, the chances are in favor of you being white \ldots the black people don't go to head shrinks as often as the white people do \ldots white people are usually shorter than black people \ldots and in general white people usually make less noise than black people \ldots usually people with really light skin speak almost in a whisper \ldots and people who have very, very mild skin are almost invisible at times \ldots white people like to live in the same zone as the other white people \ldots white people are often capable of killing a person, but they frequently decide not to \ldots Janine only sees people who fall into a certain white zone \ldots if you're not in that certain white zone, you can forget about seeing Janine, I'll tell you that much right now \ldots a punch so hard it was almost shiny \ldots a cut so deep it would glisten in the sunlight \ldots but I'm not making any promises, so don't get your hopes up \ldots she might invite you into her zone \ldots Janine can be very fickle \ldots very fickle sometimes \ldots if you get killed, say maybe on a drug bust \ldots say you're a police officer and you get killed maybe on a drug bust \ldots in that case Janine will probably place you in a certain white zone \ldots I know I'm white when people tell me I'm crazy \ldots a lot of you probably think I'm crazy \ldots right?  \ldots isn't that right, that some of y'all think I'm crazy?

MAN.  Is bitch talking to me?

WOMAN.  \ldots isn't that right?  \ldots well, at least you can all agree that I'm white \ldots and if you can do that you can probably agree that I'm crazy \ldots I know that I'm white when people tell me I'm crazy \ldots

MAN.  This bitch is fucking wacko.

WOMAN.  \ldots Janine tells me what to do \ldots not even a sunny beach is as good as having Janine tell you what to do \ldots actually, having a sunny beach is almost the same thing as having Janine tell you what to do \ldots she's very outspoken, Janine knows how to tell a story \ldots and it is true, a lot of people have been put away in crazy houses and sent to head shrinks because of Janine \ldots on account of Janine was telling them something and they couldn't pull themselves away \ldots if a potato tastes good, and then it doesn't taste good, it can't taste good anymore \ldots cause if potato zone can't taste good anymore it gets run over by all the other potatoes \ldots it might even taste like cocoa zone \ldots I had the bark of a cocoa tree one time while I was sitting in the back of the truck \ldots see the black people irritate the white people and the white people irritate the black people \ldots so if you scrape all the taste buds off the tongue of a potato, then what good is that potato to itself or others?  \ldots you can throw it away and put it down the garbage disposer \ldots if a male potato and a female potato get together and have sex their baby potato doesn't tatse like a potato \ldots say it tastes like cocoa zone \ldots you can't serve cocoa zone for dinner and try and pass it off for potato \ldots same thing with the cocoa zone \ldots you ever had cocoa zone?  \ldots see, the black people irritate the white people and the white people \ldots the white people irritate the black people \ldots see?  \ldots so if a cocoa zone tastes more like potato zone then you might as well throw it away \ldots you can't try and pass that off as a cocoa zone \ldots can't even serve it for dinner \ldots maybe a crazy person might try to \ldots

MAN.  Bitch, you are a crazy person.

WOMAN.  \ldots zone \ldots so you might as well get rid of it \ldots I'm not telling you to break the law \ldots Janine was a lawyer \ldots suitcase worked in one of those skyscraper zone \ldots ever see a sky zone?  \ldots zone \ldots I seen them first hand and I know for a fact \ldots start to wonder if the sun has to duck when it passes by through the day zone \ldots Janine was a lawyer \ldots she knows about those things \ldots she would get you on the smallest inconvenience \ldots shoes weren't tied right or hadn't brushed your teeth \ldots sperm dried on your gums \ldots you've got to brush your teeth to get the sperm off \ldots that's what some people say, anyway \ldots

MAN.  Man, I knew I shouldn't have taken the bus.

WOMAN.  \ldots Janine said forget the sperm it's not important \ldots you don't need to fill your mental zone with concerns like the number of sperm cells in the world at any given moment \ldots who cares if you've got some sperm stuck on your teeth?  \ldots do people go around examining your mouth to see if you've got sperm stuck on your teeth?  \ldots some people do \ldots usually people will carry on a conversation with you just fine \ldots Janine says forget about the sperm in your teeth \ldots people picking the sperm out of their teeth are sometimes so involved that they don't even realize what time zone they're in \ldots but you have to understand, the official zone is that you've got to get the sperm out from being stuck between your teeth before you go on with your day \ldots that's the official zone \ldots so if you saw Janine at work she would say you've got to get the sperm out from between your teeth \ldots that's what she would say if you saw her on the job \ldots get down with a hammer and a chisel and a toothpick and a key chain and a tiny piece of plastic and a lice comb \ldots you ever had lice?  \ldots I had lice once \ldots

MAN.  Bitch, get the fuck away from me.  This is crazy.  Bus driver, you tell Greyhound that I'm never taking one of these busses again.  Crazy white bitch back here talking about scraping sperm off people's teeth.  Telling us she had lice once.  Ain't nobody want to be sitting next to somebody like that.  Sheeeat.

WOMAN.  \ldots actually what you really need for the job is a screwdriver to get down \ldots to get down \ldots to get down between those cracks and really give it a good try to get all those little sperm cells out of the mouth zone \ldots before you go to have a conversation \ldots Janine has a book about getting sperm out of your teeth \ldots actually she has an entire set of books about it \ldots it's too long \ldots a line outside her office \ldots people waiting to read the books \ldots all day and all night \ldots you can never get to see her because there's always a line of people waiting outside her office to read the books \ldots she has something like \ldots something like \ldots twenty-six volumes of information that will help you get all the sperm off your teeth \ldots and the first person is reading Volume A and the second person is reading Volume B and the third person is reading Volume C and the fourth person is reading Volume D and the fifth person is reading Volume \ldots the fifth person is reading Volume E, I think it is \ldots and the sixth person is reading \ldots yes, the sixth person is reading Volume F \ldots each book has over a thousand pages in it \ldots some have upwards of over sixty or seventy thousand pages \ldots you have to read every page of every book before you can get in \ldots the print is so fine that sometimes you need a magnifying glass to read the words \ldots some books the text is so small you need a periscope \ldots yes, just to read words on a page \ldots sounds very unreasonable \ldots but people do it \ldots people do it each and every day because Janine won't let you in her office if you haven't done it \ldots if you haven't done it Janine won't let you in her office \ldots Janine won't let you in her office \ldots it's a nice office, too \ldots top floor \ldots black people kill white people sometimes \ldots

MAN.  We're gonna see it here in about two seconds.

WOMAN.  \ldots zone \ldots

MAN.  Keep talking.

WOMAN.  \ldots black people kill black people, too, at other times \ldots black people always go to jail, have you noticed that?  \ldots if you go to jail for killing somebody chances are likely that you're black \ldots everybody knows that black people go to jail \ldots but what a lot of people don't know is that black people can go to jail just for talking to a white person \ldots or a black person for that matter they can go to jail \ldots not many people know that part of the law \ldots say you're a nigger \ldots

MAN.  Say I am.

WOMAN.  \ldots say you're a nigger and you come up to some white lady and say go to hell you stupid dike-looking half-wit motherfucker \ldots you might get a parking ticket for that \ldots or a speeding ticket, just a few dollars, maybe eighty \ldots but there have been cases where just for calling her an idiot a black man got the gas chamber \ldots they don't like to electrocute black people much anymore \ldots that's even harder to clean up than scraping dried sperm off your teeth is scraping up dead people's eyeballs off the floor \ldots that's the worst part about it, too \ldots I won't lie about that \ldots it's definitely the eyeballs \ldots so if you're standing in the line at the bank, getting ready \ldots about to transfer your paycheck into your bank account \ldots standing in line at the bank and you remember that she cut you off in traffic \ldots even if she never even heard you say it \ldots go to hell you stupid dike-looking half-wit motherfucker \ldots you were thinking it and smiling at her out the window with dried sperm on your teeth \ldots it's a little known fact that not many people know but it is true that all male niggers are cocksuckers \ldots

MAN.  What did she say?  Bitch better shut the fuck up.

WOMAN.  \ldots that's okay, cause it is a little-known fact and you probably just didn't know \ldots remember that in the bank line with three people ahead of you in line \ldots even if it's just two \ldots drop your check on the floor and run outside into the street and find that lady \ldots because if she takes you to court you're getting the gas chamber \ldots or maybe even lethal injection \ldots but you might even get the chair cause even though they don't like really to clean up dead people's eyeballs they will electrocute you if they feel they have to \ldots do you know how much they pay people to scrape dead people's eyeballs off the floor of electrocution chambers?  \ldots people in that line of work do just fine, I'll tell you that much \ldots they take vacations in Maui \ldots they have a little something to put away for retirement \ldots those people do very well, indeed \ldots I knew a guy in Beverly Hills, worked as an eyeball scraper \ldots had a yacht and all of his children went to Beverly Hills schools and wore pretty little bonnets and Calvin Kline underwear \ldots I don't know cause I've never bought Calvin Kline underwear \ldots but I hear they're pretty comfortable \ldots I'll tell you one thing, that's for sure \ldots I ain't wearing no Calvin Kline underwear \ldots I can't even remember if I put underwear on this morning \ldots so if she takes your ass to court you get in the driver's side of her car \ldots if she has a convertible just jump right in the top of it \ldots tell her you wouldn't mind getting a few more sperm on your teeth \ldots tell her it's no problem \ldots you'll scrape them off yourself \ldots most people can't see em anyway without a microscope, and most people don't carry their microscope with them when they go out \ldots Janine sure doesn't \ldots I don't even think she owns a microscope \ldots you can suck the cock of a female just like you suck the cock of any male \ldots it is a little known fact that all white females have cocks \ldots a lot of people don't know it, but they do \ldots if they decide to give you the gas chamber they don't stop pumping the gas until the last breath is squeezed right out of your body \ldots the last breath \ldots if you were \ldots if you were looking at her plain thinking about putting some male sperm into her low zone \ldots you can go to jail if her low zone is already taken \ldots thinking about putting your male sperm into a reserved low zone \ldots that's illegal \ldots most people don't yet know about they new laws \ldots had to put male sperm into her low zone to go to jail \ldots now just think about putting male sperm into her low zone \ldots for that they can actually give lethal injection to the male nigger and scrape up his eyeballs off the floor \ldots exception \ldots exception to article seven, opus one-sixty-one, section eight: he's thinking about putting some male sperm into the reserved low zone of a while femals \ldots to avoid being arrested, he runs into the woods or cuts off his penis \ldots if he has one he cuts off his penis \ldots then he can run free and unrestricted \ldots he may not want to cut off his penis but he will do it anyway \ldots otherwise they will electrocute his eyeballs \ldots special regulations \ldots special regulations require him to cut off his male zone and throw it away \ldots even if it means he can never deposit male sperm into his wife's low zone ever again \ldots then he won't have to be injected \ldots Janine keeps track of the exact number of male sperm lost in the operation \ldots if you separate yourself from a woman's low zone then anyone after that who deposits male sperm into the low zone is clearly a male nigger and in addition he is also from that point on known as a cocksucker \ldots in addition that woman's status changes to that of a convicted nigger-lover and she will be deposited into the nearest prison \ldots if a male nigger separates his male zone from the female low zone then she has an open low zone for which she will be deposited in the nearest prison \ldots the problem with some people is that they disguise their speech with intrusions from other unnecessary zones \ldots their plain speech is intruded by neighboring textual zones or if it starts out melted in the first place \ldots people need to separate these zones in their head and practice unmelted thinking from the ground up \ldots intrusion by the unknowns from extruded zones is unnecessary \ldots of course when people intrude on your zone you should invite them to continue \ldots invite them to continue intruding on your zone \ldots take a piss there or lay down \ldots tell them to take a shit in your zone before they leave \ldots I got mugged at a Rite Aid like that \ldots standing looking at magazines and newspapers \ldots magazines and newspapers until \ldots sharp poke \ldots hello \ldots you got any money on you?  \ldots you got any money on you?

MAN.  Answer me you crack baby down-syndrome retard!

WOMAN.  \ldots I didn't know what to say so he shot me in the arm \ldots here's my money \ldots you can have my library card, too \ldots I don't even have a driver's license yet \ldots Janine says I might be able to get one soon \ldots that's why I have this bandage \ldots shoot me in the face if you have any guts \ldots just because I don't have a regular physician so I put an ace bandage on it \ldots

MAN.  If you don't shut up I'll put a bullet up your cunt you stupid dyke-looking half-wit motherfucker!

WOMAN.  \ldots if he asks you something else just do it, don't ask any questions \ldots just do it before he puts a bullet up your cunt \ldots the black people irritate the white people and the white people irritate the black people \ldots when it's sunny outside, it's sunny for the black people just like it's sunny for the white people, it just affects the black people's skin differently \ldots when it's raining, the rain falls on the black people just like it falls on the white people \ldots I don't know of any differences in the skin reaction to wetness between black people and white people, but I'm sure there must be some anyway \ldots if you want to make it to the top you have to jump the cushion zone \ldots you have to be perfect if you want to make it to the top \ldots I'm not saying I'm perfect \ldots if you want to be perfect, you can't let anybody know you're perfect \ldots

MAN.  Racist bitch talking about being perfect.

WOMAN.  \ldots I'm not saying that I'm perfect or that I'm not \ldots just don't let anybody know that you're perfect \ldots make sure nobody knows that you're perfect \ldots if they're perfect then nobody knows that they're perfect \ldots you think bragging is perfect?  \ldots talk in a real low whisper so people in the hallway can't hear you \ldots do you want people to know what you want?  \ldots everyone who wants something gets exactly what they want \ldots asking Janine for something does it matter if anybody else hears?  \ldots be real quiet but be sure not to mumble \ldots Janine hates mumblers \ldots get right to the point \ldots some people mumble on and on \ldots they think that when you go to Janine's office you have to use a lot of big words and show charts and graphs \ldots Janine's not the average suit of pants \ldots she does have a low zone \ldots Janine worked herself up through the ranks but she doesn't care much about charts and graphs \ldots I just tell her what I want since she's rich anyway, and since I always do exactly what she tells me to, every two weeks she makes a call over to accounting to make sure they don't forget to print my paycheck like they always do and she puts in a good word for me on my loan because I let her brother out of his sublease arrangement he has with me \ldots sometimes they forget my check anyway \ldots that's okay \ldots this is going to be the best two weeks of my life \ldots I'm just as happy now as when I got my Christmas bonus \ldots interest rates are bad right now so instead of doing my saving zone I buy ice cream \ldots ice cream doesn't cost that much anymore \ldots I used to run out of money because I used to buy everybody everything they wanted \ldots my friend Amos always wanted hot dogs and then his friend Andy also wanted hot dogs and one time Andy asked me for a CD player and that was a joke so I just laughed and I didn't really buy him the CD player \ldots now I strictly buy everyone just ice cream sorry and I never run out of money \ldots you get more money every two weeks anyway \ldots but most people don't get enough money to purchase the Calvin zone \ldots not every two weeks \ldots everybody doesn't have to have their boobs held up by the fingers of Calvin Kline \ldots I support K-Mart for your crack and K-Mart supports your crack \ldots

MAN.  You need to get some K-Mart to support your crack.

\section*{Scene 1}

\emph{The actions starts when the house opens.  As people enter, the very first hints of morning light filter through the skylight in a vaulted ceiling.  The room is a woman's bedroom.  John and Michelle are laying in a king-sized bed, sleeping.  We can see the outlines of their naked bodies through thin sheets; she is laying on her front, he on his back.  John rolls toward her, resting on his side.  Michelle stirs.  John's arm finds Michelle's back, caresses it, moving to her ass, her legs.  She sits up, sheets exposing her top half, and straddles John.  They fuck, slowly rolling around to various positions, pleasuring themselves as the morning light gradually brightens.  At this point, the house is closed and the house lights fade to blackness.  Michelle approaches an orgasm.  Then their moaning is pierced by a voice from outside the bedroom.}

CLAIRE.  MOM!!!

\emph{John is startled.  He pulls out, sits up.}

JOHN.  Who is that?

CLAIRE.  MOM!!!  I'm gonna be late for rugby!

JOHN.  I didn't know you had a---

MICHELLE.  I'll be there in a minute!

CLAIRE.  I'm gonna be late if we don't leave right now!

MICHELLE.  I need to get dressed, honey.  We're divorced.  I mean, her dad and I are--

CLAIRE.  Five minutes!

MICHELLE.  I didn't mention it because--

JOHN.  It's okay.

MICHELLE.  I was going to tell you this morning.

JOHN.  It's no problem.  Just surprised.

MICHELLE.  We've been divorced for three years.

JOHN.  No, it's not like I haven't been married before.  Just \ldots never got around to having kids.

MICHELLE.  It's \ldots interesting.

\emph{The door opens and Claire bursts into the room.  She is wearing a rugby uniform.}

CLAIRE.  You know what's fucking interesting \ldots

MICHELLE.  Claire!

CLAIRE.  Seeing you roll around with this pig.  What's your name?  Abner?

MICHELLE.  Claire, get out of here!

CLAIRE.  What do you do for a living?  Manufacture Nike's?  You look like a banker.

MICHELLE.  Claire!

CLAIRE.  You in stocks?

JOHN.  Futures.

CLAIRE.  So you're the big time.  Nice catch, Mom.  What's your name?

JOHN.  John Lorenz.

CLAIRE.  You ever been to Japan, John Lorenz?

JOHN.  Yes.

CLAIRE.  What are you doing with this bitch?

MICHELLE.  You're not going anywhere, young lady.

CLAIRE.  Don't your Japanese business fellows take you to the all-you-can-eat Asian pussy bars while you're over there?

JOHN.  There is quite a bit of prostitution in Japan.

CLAIRE.  Great.  Maybe you can get my mom a new job.

MICHELLE.  That is it.

CLAIRE.  She's tired of sleeping with corporate schmucks like yourself to improve her standing in the universe.  Wishes the world was fair.  Wishes she could be judged on a higher merit than her ability to get you off by squishing her skank mid-lifer cunt around Napoleon's dick here.

MICHELLE.  Claire, you are grounded.

JOHN.  Our professional lives don't intersect.

CLAIRE.  \emph{(at the same time as John's last line)}  Good, mom.  I was thinking about not going to rugby today anyway.  It seems clear you need some looking after.

\emph{Claire sits down on the bed.}

CLAIRE.  Bad, bad girl.

MICHELLE.  You're through with rugby.

CLAIRE.  Stupid sport anyway.  Just a bunch of girls rolling around in the mud trying to take control of the ball.  Nothing you'd be interested in, John Lorenz.  Do your Asian hookers play rugby?

MICHELLE.  You're not going to the prom with \ldots whatever his face.

CLAIRE.  Did you go to your prom, John?  \ldots  That's a shame.  You weren't into the whole stealing-young-girls'-virginity-on-prom-night thing?

\emph{Claire gets up from the bed.}

CLAIRE.  My mom didn't go, either.  You two are perfect for each other.

\emph{Claire picks up her mother's bra.}

CLAIRE.  This looks like something grandma would wear.

\emph{Claire picks up John's underwear.}

CLAIRE.  Sexy, John Lorenz.  Get some for me, okay mom?

\emph{Claire exits the room, slamming the door.  Her mother starts crying.}

JOHN.  Are you okay?

\emph{Michelle pulls herself back together.}

MICHELLE.  Fine.  Fucking wonderful.

\section*{Scene 2}

\emph{John and Michelle are in the kitchen.  She is wearing a bathrobe.  He is wearing sweatpants and a T-shirt.  John is bare-footed.  Michelle wears slippers.  They are following a recipe; a mixing bowl sits out.}

MICHELLE.  If she comes down here I don't know what I'm going to do.

JOHN.  Baking powder?

MICHELLE.  Above the sink.  What would you do?  I know you've never had kids but \ldots  I don't want to take her to counseling.  I've told her she can go by herself if she wants but she doesn't want to and I'm already going twice a week.

JOHN.  Who do you see?

MICHELLE.  Dr.  Havestein.  He runs a practice in Chelsea Tower.

JOHN.  I know the place.  Baking soda, but no baking powder.

MICHELLE.  I might have some downstairs.  Stay here, I'll be right back.

\emph{Michelle goes down some stairs to a lower level.  John flips through the newspaper.  Claire walks into the dining area and sits at the table with her back to John.  She is wearing jeans and a mod T-shirt.  He notices her come in, but goes back to reading the paper.  Claire flips on a TV.  She bends down to scratch the back of her calf through her jeans.  On her feet are socks with little pink pigs embroidered on them.  She continues watching TV, then bends down to scratch her calf again.  She feels around that section of her leg.  Something is there.  She pushes her chair out and stands up.  She unzips her jeans and pushes them down around her ankles.  John is looking at Claire; her panties entice.  In this position, without moving her legs or bending her knees, she bends down and removes a dryer sheet.  She places the dryer sheet on the table, pulls up her pants, zips them, and sits back down to watch TV.  As she is sitting back down, Michelle re-enters from the basement.}

MICHELLE.  Here we go.  Is that everything we need?

JOHN.  I think so.

MICHELLE.  Do you need any help?

JOHN.  Thanks, I've got it.

MICHELLE.  Claire, would you like to have some waffles when they're ready?

\emph{As Claire speaks here, she continues watching TV.}

CLAIRE.  Sure.

MICHELLE.  Great.  After breakfast I'm picking some things up from the dry cleaner and John's going to take me to the airport.

CLAIRE.  Where you going this week?

MICHELLE.  Philadelphia.

CLAIRE.  What's going on there?

MICHELLE.  I'm meeting with some people from CMC.  They're going to show us their respiratory-blocker engineering process.

CLAIRE.  Sounds like they've been up to no good.

JOHN.  What is that, exactly?

MICHELLE.  Among other things, CMC makes pesticides.  They have a computer simulation of parts of the cellular respiratory process of certain nasty bugs which people like to kill, like roaches.  Using this simulation, the computer can engineer plans for a new type of molecule which acts as a respiratory inhibitor for just that species or a few related species of bug.  It kills almost instantly and it is completely harmless to all other species.  Supposedly.  We'll see.  It should be fun; I like Philadelphia, anyway.

JOHN.  Waffle number one.

\emph{John forks the waffle onto a plate.  Michelle takes the plate to her daughter.}

MICHELLE.  Claire, would you like this one?

CLAIRE.  Does it have nuts in it?

MICHELLE.  No.

CLAIRE.  Sure.  Thanks.

\emph{Michelle sets the plate down.  Claire begins to butter the waffle.  Michelle walks back over to John.  She hugs and kisses him.  They whisper to each other.  Claire drowns the waffle in syrup.  She takes a bite, then picks up the remote control and switches the TV to the Playboy channel.  Sex action on screen.  No one notices.  She turns up the volume.  Michelle and John both look over.}

MICHELLE.  Welcome to breakfast at the Coghlan household.

\emph{Claire makes no reaction.}

MICHELLE.  Claire, turn that back to Tom and Jerry, please.

\emph{Claire sits, eating.  Michelle goes over and stands by Claire.}

MICHELLE.  I'd like to talk with you upstairs.

CLAIRE.  Me too, but I'm eating right now.

MICHELLE.  Claire!  Now.

\emph{Claire cuts another bite, eats it, wipes her mouth, gets up from the table, and heads toward the stairs.  Michelle takes the remote, turns the TV back to cartoons, and follows Claire upstairs.  At the base of the stairs, she gestures to John that it will just be a minute.  Claire and Michelle disappear upstairs.  John puts another waffle on.  He then turns and looks at the dining table.  He walks to it and stares at the television.  Then he looks at the table.  He picks up the dryer sheet and holds it to his face.  He breathes in deeply through his nose.}

\section*{Scene 3}

\emph{Claire is sitting in the living room on the couch.  Her body is covered with an afghan.  The television is on.  She is watching Tom and Jerry.  It is night, and the only light inside the house comes from the TV.  A key fiddles in the door on the outside.  The door opens.  John walks in.}

CLAIRE.  Who gave you a key?  I suppose my mom told you to keep an eye on me while she's in Philadelphia.  Or is she having you feed the dog?

\emph{John closes the door and steps all the way into the house.  He looks around the place, steps into the kitchen.}

CLAIRE.  We don't have a dog, dipshit.

JOHN.  I'm not looking for a dog.

CLAIRE.  What are you looking for?

\emph{He stands behind the couch, looking at her.  She flips the TV to the Playboy channel.  He comes around to the front of the couch.  She stands up, keeping the afghan about her body.  We can see no additional clothing.}

CLAIRE.  Do you like Tom and Jerry?

\emph{His hand reaches out to touch her breasts over the cloth.  She takes his hand and puts it on her skin directly.}

CLAIRE.  Are you waiting for me to stop you, John Lorenz?  Is that what you thought I'd do?  Scream for help?  Yell stop?  Tell you no?  Is that what you wanted?  Is that what you expected?  Did you want to fuck everything up?  Did you want me to complain to mommy when she gets back that you came over and touched her daughter in a bad place?  Did you want her to dump you?  Did you want her to call the police?

JOHN.  No.

CLAIRE.  I think you did.

JOHN.  Why do you think that?

\emph{She sits him on the couch.  Unbuttons his shirt, takes off his belt.  Undoes his pants and pulls them down.  Claire fucks John, straddling him, her breasts and hair in his face.  He cums.  She gets off of him, sits beside him.  There is silence and staring into space.}

CLAIRE.  What's your favorite movie, John Lorenz?

JOHN.  Heat \ldots with Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro.

CLAIRE.  What's your favorite scene?

JOHN.  The bank robbery.

CLAIRE.  Of course.  Do you like the ending?

JOHN.  Yeah.

CLAIRE.  I figured you did.  I hate that ending.  I never watch the ending.

JOHN.  Why don't you like it?

CLAIRE.  The same reason you do like it.  The bad guys get caught.  Movies are better if the bank robbers get thwarted while the robbery is in progress.  Better because then people get shot and you have a car chase and a lot of noise and some explosions.  But the ending you want in real life is the perfect crime with no plot twists, no fuck-ups, no trace at all of the dramatic.  The good ending in real life is quiet, and nobody notices, and nobody gets famous or dead.  In real life you rob the bank, get away alive with all the money, you move to a third world country and live on your yacht having sex with AIDS-tested supermodels, and that's a good ending.

\emph{Claire hands John Lorenz his shirt, and he gets dressed.  She pays no attention to him; she stares at the television.  He stands up, completely dresses, and waits as if something else could happen.  After letting him stand there, Claire gets up and leads him to the door.}

CLAIRE.  Go home, John Lorenz, go home.  You win the prize.  You didn't get caught.  You're the winner, a real story-book ending.  Next week my mom will come home and she'll be so happy to see you.  She'll ask if I behaved, and you'll say yes.  She'll tell you she missed you and you'll tell her you missed her, too.  When she's sucking your dick you'll think about tonight, about the time you had with me.  You'll wish it was me on top of you.  You'll wish you had a little tighter pussy to fuck.  Then some Saturday the three of us will be sitting in there eating waffles.  You'll make smalltalk with me, trying not to be too familiar.  You'll side with my mom against me, not because you like her more but because you don't want her to know about us.  And I'll sit here, watching Tom and Jerry, eating waffles, staring at the TV, not paying any attention to either of you.  You'll want to talk about it, you'll wish that I would let you fuck me again sometime.  But I won't talk about it.  And I won't let you fuck me again.  So go home, John Lorenz.  Go home to that stack of pornos you have hidden under the sink in your bathroom.  You got everything you wanted.  Can you live with that?

\emph{Claire turns from him and sits back down on the couch.  She flips it back to Tom and Jerry.  John goes to the door, opens it slowly, steps out, looks back at her for a while, then turns and shuts the door.  With the door shut the house is dark, but the music continues for a moment before fading away.}

\section*{Scene 4}

\emph{John and Michelle are sitting in a nice restaurant.  They are dressed up.  They are laughing.  Michelle smokes a cigarette.}

EXPIDITER.  Can I get you two something to drink?

MICHELLE.  New Orleans.

JOHN.  The same.

EXPIDITER.  Excellent.  Your server will be with you shortly.

MICHELLE.  You know, I didn't think the special effects were all that great.

JOHN.  You have to be joking.

MICHELLE.  No.  I don't see what the big deal was.  Just a bunch of anti-gravity people doing mediocre martial arts with those computer-generated bullshit werewolves.  Stupid, stupid movie.

JOHN.  I sort-of liked it.

MICHELLE.  I sort-of liked it, too.  There was nothing special about the effects, however.  They were stolen from some nineteen-sixty-nine sci-fi film about ants that take over the earth.

JOHN.  I think I saw that one.

MICHELLE.  No way.

JOHN.  Yeah, where some desert hillbillies and half the U.S.  Reserve go ballistic with flame-throwers, chasing giant ants across the desert, torching them with napalm \ldots

MICHELLE.  Wow.  I thought I was the only person who saw that movie.  I'm always telling people about it, but no one's ever heard of it.

JOHN.  I would think your people at CMC would love that one, with all their respiration-blocking insect killers.

MICHELLE.  Those people were freaky.  Jamie, this business analyst on my team, asked them if they had thought about biological warfare.  And their team leader says, yes, we're well aware of the implications for biological warfare.  No big deal.  Who knows what else those people are cooking up over there.  Or who they're selling it to.

JOHN.  That's a scary thought.

\emph{The server comes to their table carrying their drinks.}

SERVER.  Hi, my name is Mike, and I'll be your server.  How you folks doing this evening?

JOHN.  Fine, just fine.

SERVER.  I'm glad to hear that.  Tonight our special is the roasted swordfish, straight from the coast of Norway, served with your choice of salad.  We typically recommend a Chardonnay with that, but I see you two have already chosen to drink something a little more \ldots shall we say \ldots hard core.  Do you need a moment to look over the menu or do you know what you'd like?

MICHELLE.  Ready?

JOHN.  Yeah.

MICHELLE.  You go first.

JOHN.  I'd like a chicken sandwich.  Grilled.

SERVER.  Soup or salad?

JOHN.  No, thanks.

SERVER.  You, ma'am?

MICHELLE.  Cheeseburger.  Burnt.

SERVER.  Soup or salad?

MICHELLE.  No.

SERVER.  Okay.  We'll have that right out for you.  If you need anything, just yell.

\emph{John takes a big sip of his drink.}

MICHELLE.  Do you know what's in those?

JOHN.  The only thing I know about these is they taste real good and they get you drunk real fast.

MICHELLE.  Is that what we want?

JOHN.  Yeah, I guess so.  Drink up.

\emph{She drinks up.}

JOHN.  Holy shit.  You're gonna die.

MICHELLE.  Drink up, big boy, drink up.

\emph{He drinks up.}

JOHN.  Don't feel a thing.

MICHELLE.  Wait two minutes.  Wanna dance?

JOHN.  We better get started while it's still possible.

\emph{They get up and dance.}

MICHELLE.  You feelin' that drink at all?

JOHN.  Not yet.  Are you?

MICHELLE.  A little.  But I don't think it's really hitting me, I think I'm just imagining it.  Are you coming home with me tonight?

JOHN.  We could go to my place.

MICHELLE.  I don't want Claire to be there by herself.

MICHELLE.  You know what we need to do?  We need to take a weekend away.

JOHN.  What about Claire?

MICHELLE.  She can stay with a friend.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Just the two of us \ldots  Where do you want to go?  Somewhere far away?  Someplace exotic?  You just want to check into the Hyatt in town?

JOHN.  I have a place on the beach in New Jersey.

MICHELLE.  Oooh.  That could be nice.  Sound of the waves.

JOHN.  Have you ever had sex on the beach?

MICHELLE.  No.  Take me there.

JOHN.  It's set then.  You pick the weekend.

MICHELLE.  This one.  I'm not travelling.  Sex on the beach.  Mike!

SERVER.  Yes, ma'am.

MICHELLE.  More drinks, please, dear.

SERVER.  Of course.

JOHN.  Now are you feeling that drink?  Or is it still just your imagination?

MICHELLE.  Really feeling.  Imagining you without any clothes on.  Imagining \ldots sacking you in the surf.  Waves and our bodies and fresh seafood.  You have to be a seafood fan.

JOHN.  Only when I'm by the sea.

MICHELLE.  Me too.  Me too.  Let's do something really naughty tonight.  Don't you ever want to do something really naughty?

JOHN.  Like what?

MICHELLE.  Let's get some edible panties.  Or a glow-in-the-dark condom or some lingere.

JOHN.  Okay.

MICHELLE.  It'll be fun.  There's a store up the street like that.  I've never gone in there \ldots do you want to?

JOHN.  Sure.

SERVER.  Drinks.  Enjoy.

\emph{John and Michelle sit down and take sips.}

JOHN.  We need to lock the bedroom door this time.

MICHELLE.  I'm sorry about that.  She can be a little \ldots unrestrained.

JOHN.  Has she done that with \ldots  I mean, has she walked in on you with anyone else?  I--I'm inquiring about her activity, not yours.

MICHELLE.  It's okay.  No she hasn't.  Stood outside the door and tried to hold a conversation, yes.  But she's never walked in like that before.

JOHN.  Is she a good student?

MICHELLE.  Straight A's.

JOHN.  Does she cause trouble in school?

MICHELLE.  Not on the surface.  If she does anything she's gotten away with it this far.  She gets it out at Rugby, I think.  For the most part, they love her down there.  Except that she's not Catholic.

JOHN.  Catholic school?

MICHELLE.  St.  Mary's.

JOHN.  And they like her there?

MICHELLE.  Except that she's not Catholic, yes.  She gets good grades, plays a sport.  Doesn't sell drugs in the lunchroom like some of the students.  Hasn't been caught manufacturing fake IDs.  Like some of the students.

JOHN.  I read about that.

MICHELLE.  Divorce is hard on kids.  I'm sorry to her for that.  But I do my best.  She gets what she needs.  And for the most part, I think she's doing alright.  It's hard to be that age.  Very uncertain.  You're uncomfortable with yourself.  Unsure.  People in that situation do weird things sometimes.

JOHN.  Yeah.

MICHELLE.  My counselor thinks she might benefit from therapy.  But if she doesn't want to go \ldots what good will it do?

JOHN.  You know what?

MICHELLE.  What, handsome?

JOHN.  I am so fucking drunk.  I just want to take my clothes off right here and lay you down on this table.

MICHELLE.  We will we will \ldots just let's get the edible panties first.

\emph{The server brings their food out.}

MICHELLE.  We'll get the edible panties, we'll get some glow-in-the-dark condoms, I'll buy some lingere, we'll remember to lock the door this time, and then you can lay me down on this table right here and screw the poop out of me.

SERVER.  Ma'am.  Sir.

\emph{Michelle realizes that the server has been standing there.  She looks at him and busts out laughing.  Then she looks at her plate.  She picks the cheeseburger up off the plate, surveys it, and plop-drops it right back down on the plate.  She stares amazed.  In a voice loud enough for the entire restaurant to hear, she says}

MICHELLE.  Jesus Christ.  This is the biggest fucking cheeseburger I have ever seen!

\section*{Scene 5}

\emph{Michelle's living room.  Empty.  Early evening.  The door opens and in walks John, carrying a weekend getaway bag and roses.  He walks into the kitchen.  No one is there.  He sets the roses on the counter.  He walks back into the living room.  Claire comes downstairs in her school uniform.}

JOHN.  Is Michelle here?

CLAIRE.  Not even a thought to me.  Michelle isn't here yet.  Excited about your little weekend getaway?

JOHN.  Yes.

CLAIRE.  Doing anything social or are you just going to bang my mom all weekend.

JOHN.  Probably just going to bang your mom all weekend.

CLAIRE.  Shhh \ldots she's upstairs.  Just kidding, she's still at work.  She called to say she'll be home in a while.  If John gets here, make him comfortable.  Try to be nice.  I'm trying.  See, I've got my Catholic schoolgirl outfit on just for you.  I can sit right here, with my legs crossed, revealing nothing, and you can wish you were inside these leggings, wish you were up this skirt.  How's the futures business?

JOHN.  Corn is up.  Sugar's down.

CLAIRE.  You don't sound too happy about that.  Why don't you come upstairs?  I'll cheer you up.

JOHN.  I think I'll wait here.

CLAIRE.  I'm going to strip my clothes off for you now.  Then I'm going to let you fuck me, just a quick one.

JOHN.  No.

CLAIRE.  You have a choice to make.  Would you like to do it here or do you want me to show you my bedroom?

JOHN.  Neither.

CLAIRE.  Why are you so sour today?  Is it the corn?  Or the sugar?  Buy or sell, John Lorenz?  I think you'll like my bedroom.  Believe it or not, it's all pink.  Very virginal.  You can smell my perfume, you know?  I'll let you go through my panty drawer and you can pick out a souvenir for this weekend.  Something to keep you company while you're with my mom.

JOHN.  I'm not going to do anything with you.

CLAIRE.  Then your choice becomes : would you like for me to strip for you here or in my bedroom?

\emph{Claire starts to strip.}

CLAIRE.  It would have been better for you to choose my bedroom because if my mom walks in right now, and I'm stripping for you here, then she'll see it, and that might put an interesting spin on your weekend.

JOHN.  Stop.

\emph{Claire continues to strip, leaving the removed articles all around the room.  John picks up the items and tries to return them to her, this causes him to be following her.}

CLAIRE.  Schoolgirl shoes with buckles.

JOHN.  Stop.

CLAIRE.  Schoolgirl leggings.  Virgin white.  Note the scent.

JOHN.  Claire.

CLAIRE.  You're missing the scent.  That's part of the whole deal.  Smell those right now.

JOHN.  I'm not going to smell--

CLAIRE.  Schoolgirl sweater.  Very preppy.

JOHN.  Put this back on.

\emph{Claire has arrived at the stairs, is a few steps up already.  She is facing John, below.  She lets her hair out.}

CLAIRE.  Schoolgirl hairpins.

JOHN.  Claire, stop.

CLAIRE.  Plaid schoolgirl skirt.  The quintessential schoolgirl item.  Mother's not going to want to find that laying around, because that means that her little schoolgirl is left wearing only her schoolgirl panties, her schoolgirl Oxford shirt, and underneath, her schoolgirl bra.  Let's do the shirt next.

\emph{She unbuttons her shirt.  John protests at each button.}

JOHN.  Claire.  Stop.  Claire.  \emph{(etc., as she unbuttons)}

\emph{She has finished.  She throws the shirt at him.}

JOHN.  Jesus.

CLAIRE.  Come upstairs.

\emph{Claire continues upstairs, John follows.  When the top half of Claire's body is out of sight, she throws her bra to the bottom of the stairs.  John goes down to retrieve it.  He goes back up.}

CLAIRE.  Now.  Am I going to have to make you go get my panties from down there, or are you going to take them off of me?

\emph{We hear Claire squeal with delight.}

CLAIRE.  That's what I like.

\emph{We hear her voice upstairs, without seeing them.}

CLAIRE.  Do you like it?  I told you it was all pink.  Do you want to fuck me, or do you just wanna mess around?

\emph{We hear the bed squeak.}

CLAIRE.  I though you wanted to fuck me.  Isn't this nice.  Ohhh \ldots do me.  I wanna feel you inside of me.  Oh my god!  Yes!  This will make you forget about the sugar and the corn, won't it, John Lorenz?  Oh!  Oh!  Yes!  Talk dirty to me.  I like it.

JOHN.  I've been wanting you all week, Claire.  I've been wanting to fuck your pink little pussy.  I was hoping you'd show me your room.  I'm glad you did.

CLAIRE.  Talk to me more.

JOHN.  I can't stop thinking about you.  I've been wanting to fuck you ever since last time.  Do you like feeling my dick inside of you?  Do you?

CLAIRE.  Yes \ldots

JOHN.  Good, cause I like having it inside of you.  I like fucking you, Claire.  I like fucking you.  I wanna fuck you until you--

CLAIRE.  Yes!  Yes!  Ohhh!

\emph{Downstairs, the door opens, and Michelle enters.}

MICHELLE.  John?

\emph{There is a big thunk from upstairs.  Michelle goes to the stairs.}

MICHELLE.  What's going on up there?

CLAIRE.  Nothing, mom.  I just dropped my suitcase.

MICHELLE.  It sounded like you dropped a cinderblock.  What do you have in there?  Why do you need a suitcase just to go to Marianne's house for a weekend?

CLAIRE.  My bookbag's too small.

\emph{Michelle goes into the kitchen, sees the roses.  She looks for John in the living room.}

MICHELLE.  Were is John?

CLAIRE.  Don't know, mom.  Haven't seen him.

MICHELLE.  His car's out front.  His bag is right here.  John?  Is he in the bathroom?  John?

\emph{Claire walks downstairs, wrapped in two towels.  She surveys John's bag.}

CLAIRE.  You're right, his bag is right here.

\emph{Michelle comes back from checking the bathroom.}

MICHELLE.  You haven't seen him?

CLAIRE.  Well, clearly he's been here, but I didn't hear him come in.  I've been in the shower, though.

MICHELLE.  Maybe he's in my room.

\emph{Michelle goes upstairs.}

MICHELLE.  John?

\emph{Michelle comes back downstairs.}

MICHELLE.  You haven't seen him?

CLAIRE.  Not today.

CLAIRE.  I'm going to finish packing.

MICHELLE.  Okay.  I'll take you over there when you're ready.

\emph{Michelle goes into the kitchen and picks up the phone.  It is a cordless.  She dials a number.}

MICHELLE.  Yes.  Is Jonathan Lorenz there?  \ldots  Do you know when he left?  \ldots  Okay.  \ldots  No, I'll try him elsewhere.

\emph{She hangs up, dials a number.  Waits.}

MICHELLE.  Hey, it's me.  Where are you?  Your stuff is here and I'm guessing you probably just \ldots went out to get \ldots something for the weekend \ldots or \ldots well, thanks for the roses, they're lovely, and \ldots I don't know \ldots just \ldots call me.

\emph{She hangs up and stares at the roses.  She picks up the phone and dials another number.  A phone rings in the living room.  She goes into the living room with her phone and sees that his cell phone is laying on top of his weekend bag.  She picks it up, presses talk, and, with one phone to each ear, says}

MICHELLE.  Hello?  Fuck!

\emph{Michelle hangs up his phone, then hers, then slumps down on the couch.  She looks at her watch, then flips on the TV.  It is tuned to the Playboy channel.  She flips the TV off.}

MICHELLE.  Claire, what is your obsession with \ldots !?

CLAIRE.  Say that again.  I couldn't hear you.

MICHELLE.  Forget it.

\emph{Michelle sinks back on the couch stares into space.  A lighting transition skips us an hour into the future.  Claire is sitting on a chair in the living room.  Michelle is still on the couch.  We see them sitting in silence for a moment before Claire speaks.}

CLAIRE.  So is this dick gonna show, or what?

MICHELLE.  Claire.

CLAIRE.  Just asking.  Maybe he forgot.

MICHELLE.  You're not going to Marianne's.

\emph{Claire stands up.}

CLAIRE.  Fine.

\emph{Claire goes upstairs.  A lighting transition skips us ahead some more.  Michelle is still sitting on the couch.  She looks at her watch.  Dials a phone number.}

MICHELLE.  Non-emergency.  \ldots  Yes, can I speak to someone about a missing person?  \ldots  Sure.

\emph{Michelle hangs up the phone.}

MICHELLE.  Shit.

\emph{A lighting transition skips us ahead some more.  Michelle is still sitting on the couch.  Claire comes downstairs.  She steps over to her mom, puts a hand on her.}

CLAIRE.  Still a no-show?

\emph{Michelle looks at Claire.}

CLAIRE.  Sorry, mom.

\emph{Claire goes into the kitchen and comes out with a bottle of Karo syrup.  She goes upstairs.}

\section*{Scene 6}

\emph{Claire's bedroom.  John is sitting on her bed fully clothed.  He picks up a teddy bear and throws it.  Claire walks in with a bottle of Karo syrup.  She hands the bottle to John, then goes and picks up the teddy bear, putting it back in its original position.}

CLAIRE.  Are you hungry?

JOHN.  Is she asleep yet?

CLAIRE.  No she's not.  I'll tell you when she goes to sleep.  Until then, you can just assume that she's still awake.  Okay?

JOHN.  This is totally fucked up.

CLAIRE.  Beats your typical weekend getaway, though.

JOHN.  For you, maybe.

CLAIRE.  That's what I meant.  For me.  I'm gonna get undressed.  Why don't you open that bottle of syrup.

JOHN.  Why?

CLAIRE.  Why?  Because you're gonna lick it off me.

JOHN.  I don't think so.

CLAIRE.  You don't?

\emph{Claire opens her bedroom door.}

CLAIRE.  Then I don't think I'm gonna keep hiding you here in my room.  Mom!!!

MICHELLE.  What?

JOHN.  No, no.  Okay.  Close the door.

MICHELLE.  What is it, Claire?

CLAIRE.  Nothing, I couldn't find my remote there for a second.  I found it.

MICHELLE.  Go to sleep, honey.  It's two in the morning.

CLAIRE.  I will soon.

\emph{Claire closes the door.}

CLAIRE.  Now open that bottle.  I'm going to make myself more comfortable.  Feel free to do the same.

JOHN.  No thanks.

CLAIRE.  If you're good I'll let you fuck me after.

JOHN.  Joy.

CLAIRE.  You know you want to.  You know what the difference is between you and me, John Lorenz?

\emph{John shrugs and looks up at her.}

CLAIRE.  I'll tell you.  The difference between you and me is that if I was in your situation right now, I'd enjoy it.  Everything in life has at least two sides.  You might as well at least enjoy the one that favors you at the moment.  You're held captive in the bedroom of a teenage girl who you want to fuck.  A teenage girl who lets you fuck her.  Who strips for you.  Who sucks your dick.  And \ldots she happens to be the daughter of your girlfriend.  And \ldots the fact that you followed me upstairs to fuck me has gotten you into a pickle, and caused your girlfriend to be momentarily upset with you.  So what?  She'll fall asleep in a little while, and if I'm feeling good about you when that happens, I'll let you go.  You can make up a story about why you were called away suddenly, and life will go on.  In the mean time, take off your pants.  Pour some Karo syrup on my pussy and eat me out.  I'll play with my nipples while you do it.  Then your dick will get hard, and we can fuck like little bunnies of the field.  I'll let you take me from behind.  I'll put on my uniform and you can rip it off of me.  We can take a shower together.  My door locks, see?

\emph{She locks her door.  She straddles him from behind on the bed.  She undoes his belt.}

CLAIRE.  I don't care.  I want to play with you, too.  And as long as everyone is sufficiently quiet about it, no one will ever know.  Good?

\emph{Claire has settled herself on the bed in front of him.  She is ready for him to eat her.  The bottle is open, and he is about to pour it on her.}

CLAIRE.  Pour it on nice and thick, John Lorenz.

\section*{Scene 7}

\emph{Michelle's bedroom in complete darkness.  The door opens, there stands John's silhouette against light in the hallway.  Michelle, who is laying in bed, flips on a lamp.}

MICHELLE.  What happened to you?

JOHN.  Something came up at work.

MICHELLE.  Came up after you go here?

JOHN.  Murray called me on my cell phone and picked me up in his car, in front of your house.  Right after I got here.

MICHELLE.  What was it?  What was it that you couldn't call me?  Why didn't you call me?

JOHN.  It was disorganized.  We were meeting with a group of guys.  We were making a deal, and we were in a meeting.  I couldn't leave.

MICHELLE.  Murray doesn't have a cell phone?

JOHN.  He didn't have it with him.  I tried to call you.  I wanted to call you.

MICHELLE.  What kind of deal comes up instantly on Friday afternoon?

JOHN.  It's complicated.  I can tell you the details tomorrow.

MICHELLE.  Tell me now.  I'd like to know.

JOHN.  Look, I'm sorry I worried you.  A lot was at stake.  And I should've called you, but I couldn't.

MICHELLE.  I was really worried about you.  I stayed up, downstairs.  I called your cell phone but you left it here.  I called you place.  I called the police--I wondered what might have happened.  Don't do that to me.  Don't \ldots do that to me.  Okay?

JOHN.  I'm sorry I worried you.  And I'm sorry about our weekend.

MICHELLE.  I really needed this weekend.  I really needed to get away.

JOHN.  I'm sorry, baby.  I'm sorry.  We'll go the next weekend you're free.

MICHELLE.  I wanted to go this weekend.

JOHN.  I'm sorry.  Don't cry.  Do you want some water?

MICHELLE.  No.

JOHN.  Are you sure?

MICHELLE.  Would you get me some milk?

JOHN.  Yes.  I'll be right back.

\emph{John exits the room.}

\section*{Scene 8}

\emph{John turns on the kitchen light.  Claire is sitting on the breakfast table in her nightgown.}

JOHN.  Jesus.  You startled me.

CLAIRE.  Put your dick inside of me.

JOHN.  Not now.

CLAIRE.  Just for a second.  I'm already wet.  Come here.

JOHN.  We've got to stop this, Claire.

CLAIRE.  I don't want to stop.  Come here.

\emph{She feels him up and unzips his pants.}

JOHN.  Please, stop.

CLAIRE.  I want to feel your dick inside of me.  Right here on this table.  Right now, just for a second, before you go back upstairs to her.  Give it to me.  There, like that.  Yeah \ldots

JOHN.  She's waiting for me.

CLAIRE.  Just a little bit more.  There we go.

JOHN.  She's gonna wonder what took me so long.  I just came down to get a glass of milk.

CLAIRE.  Ooh.  Ooh.

JOHN.  I've got to go.

CLAIRE.  In a minute.  Ahh.  Let me ask you a question, John Lorenz.

JOHN.  What is that?

CLAIRE.  Have you ever toed a girl?

JOHN.  I don't think so.  I suppose that would be sticking your toe up--

CLAIRE.  Yes.  You know what I think I'd like?

JOHN.  To toe a girl?

CLAIRE.  To be toed.  By you.  Tomorrow morning at breakfast.

JOHN.  Claire \ldots

CLAIRE.  I'll sit across from you and I won't wear any panties.  You can stick your toe up the leg of my shorts.  You'll need to be barefoot obviously.  Wait 'till my mom sits down beside you so she can't see.

JOHN.  I'm not gonna do that.

CLAIRE.  Yes you are.

JOHN.  Do you want us to get caught?

CLAIRE.  No, remember what I told you before?  You're the one who wants us to get caught.  I want us to get away with it.  And we will.  We will, don't worry.

JOHN.  It's too risky.  I'll toe you in your bedroom.  I'll toe you when your mom is out of town.  I'm not gonna toe you at the breakfast table.

\emph{Claire puts a finger on his nose.}

CLAIRE.  Yes, you are.

\emph{Claire pushes him away.  He fills a glass with milk.}

CLAIRE.  After she falls asleep, I want you to come down here to me and finish this off.  Then you can go back up to her.  Understand?

JOHN.  Yeah, okay.

CLAIRE.  If you don't meet me down here I'll go into that bedroom and fuck you while she sleeps.  And from what I know about you, John Lorenz, I think that might be just a little too close for comfort.  True?

JOHN.  True.

\emph{John goes back into the bedroom.  Michelle is asleep.  John sets the milk down on the nightstand and tucks Michelle's covers in around her.  He turns off the lamp.  John opens the bedroom door, silhouetted by the hall light, and goes back into the hallway.}

\section*{Scene 9}

\emph{It is morning in the kitchen/breakfast room at Michelle's house.  Claire is sitting at the table watching Tom and Jerry.  Michelle and John are following a recipe.}

MICHELLE.  Claire, honey, are you going to be hungry for waffles?

CLAIRE.  I sure am.

MICHELLE.  Good, cause we're making \ldots how many do we have batter here for?

JOHN.  Ten to twelve.

MICHELLE.  So that's \ldots three per person?  I think I can only eat two.  Claire, how many are you planning on eating?

CLAIRE.  I suppose I could eat three.  I'll need my strength for this afternoon's bone crushing.

MICHELLE.  Rugby game.

CLAIRE.  Those St.  Agnes pussies are about to meet up with The Inquisition.

MICHELLE.  Claire.

CLAIRE.  Sorry, Mom, but this planet-of-the-apes bitch on their team gave Janet a concussion last time we played them.  St.  Agnes is fucking going down.

MICHELLE.  It surprises me that a Catholic school even has a rugby team.  Even if all the players don't take it as seriously as Claire.

CLAIRE.  John, can I have nuts in my waffle today?

JOHN.  Do we have any nuts?

MICHELLE.  I have some walnuts.  They aren't chopped.

JOHN.  If someone will chop them I'll add it to the mix.

CLAIRE.  I will chop them.

\emph{Michelle gets Claire a cutting board, a knife, and a pile of walnuts.  In the process, John has to move out of her way.  Michelle pays him with a lip kiss.  Claire chops the nuts.}

CLAIRE.  You two seem like you're doing well.

MICHELLE.  What do you mean by that?

CLAIRE.  It's none of my business, of course, but it just seems to me that things are going very well between the two of you.  Is that true?

MICHELLE.  Well, yes, honey.

CLAIRE.  John?

JOHN.  I deeply value the time I spend with your mother.

CLAIRE.  I'm glad you two have each other.  I mean, I know the three of us have had some rough times, mostly because of me, but I feel like we're through that, you know?

MICHELLE.  Well, things can be difficult some times.

CLAIRE.  Sure they can, sure they can.  But you know what they say.  If life gives you lemons, hold out for strawberries.  If life gives you strawberries, hold out for cake.  And if life gives you cake, don't share it with anyone.

\emph{No one says anything to this.}

JOHN.  Waffle number one.

MICHELLE.  Claire?  You want this?

CLAIRE.  Let's all eat together today.  We can store these in the oven until several are ready.  Ice-breaker question for the day : Mom, what's your favorite movie?

MICHELLE.  There's this old movie about giant ants that take over the earth that I really like.  But I guess \ldots my favorite modern movie \ldots is \ldots Sleepless in Seattle.

CLAIRE.  Boo.

MICHELLE.  I know.  Typical chick flick.

CLAIRE.  Beyond typical chick flick.  They meet in the last scene.  You have to wait for the sequel before the main characters have their first bit of dialog.  What do you like, John?

JOHN.  I guess, if I had to pick, all time my favorite movie, the movie I like to re-watch most, is Heat with Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro.

CLAIRE.  Really?  You like all that bank robber stuff?

JOHN.  I like the action.  I'm an action movie kind-of-guy.  Car chases, explosions, you know.  Special effects.

CLAIRE.  I'm not much for special effects.  I like movies where all the action takes place in one room.  Where you're face-to-face with the characters themselves.  People these days put too much on the scenery, the goddamn effects.  It's all about the people inside the film.  What they want.

MICHELLE.  So what's your favorite movie?

CLAIRE.  It would have to be something like \ldots The Breakfast Club.  There's a movie with movement but hardly any action.  No effects, almost no music.  Interpersonal dynamics.  The characters.  That's drama.  That's a movie.

MICHELLE.  I tried to watch that one time but I fell asleep.  Not because it was boring.  I was just tired.  Now that I work I can't watch movies at home anymore.  I always fall asleep.

JOHN.  Most of the movies I see are on planes.

CLAIRE.  Icebreaker trivia question number two.

MICHELLE.  Do we need an icebreaker?

CLAIRE.  Expression.  Did you hear what happened yesterday?

JOHN.  Domestic, or international?

CLAIRE.  Very domestic.  No?  About the woman at Clover Leaf mall?

JOHN.  Don't know.

CLAIRE.  You didn't hear about that?

MICHELLE.  I'm sure I don't want to hear this.

CLAIRE.  Probably not.  But you need to hear it for your own safety.  There's this woman who has been shopping and when she goes out to her car to go home she sees that she has a flat tire.  She looks around and sees a guy walking by.  She asks this guy for help, and he agrees to help her change her tire.  She opens the trunk of her car so that he can get the spare.  He gets the spare out, jacks up her car, and changes the tire.  He puts the flat tire in the trunk.  They close the trunk.  The lady thanks him and figures he'll just be on his way.  But he says, lady, I'm parked all the way over on the other side of the parking lot.  Would you mind giving me a lift to my car?  It's not that far if we drive but it's a long way to walk, and I'm tired from helping you change your tire, etcetera.  The lady thinks he seems like a nice enough man but on principle doesn't want to let him into her car.  She explains this to him and he gets upset.  After all, this is probably just a regular guy and he has just helped her change her tire.  All he wants is a short ride to his car.  He probably means her no harm.  But she refuses to give him a ride and he gets really mad and leaves.  The woman thinks it's probably nothing, but she decides to go back inside and tell the police.  A mall officer listens to her story and walks her back to her car.  The man is nowhere to be seen, but they open in the trunk, and discover that he left his briefcase inside.  They open it.  Inside is a butcher knife and a length of rope.

MICHELLE.  Oh!  That's horrible.

CLAIRE.  No kidding.

MICHELLE.  Did you make that up?

CLAIRE.  Swear to god, I saw it on the six-o-clock news.

JOHN.  I mean no disrespect to the gravity of that story, but our waffles are ready.

MICHELLE.  Thanks for making them, John.

CLAIRE.  Yeah, John, thanks.

JOHN.  So, what does the week hold for you?

MICHELLE.  More meetings.  I think somebody high up decided that this week is going to be a meeting intensive.  I'm in meetings all day for four days solid.  And I've got some on Friday.

JOHN.  Crazy.

MICHELLE.  Yeah.  It's really nuts.  It almost it like somebody planned it this way.  What about you?  Anything exciting going on?

JOHN.  I'll be in Japan mid-week.  Just a hobnob visit.  Back on Thursday.

\emph{Claire scoots her chair in closer to the table.}

CLAIRE.  There we go.

JOHN.  Jesus!

MICHELLE.  Are you alright?

JOHN.  Got a nut \ldots stuck in my tooth.  Hurts kinda bad.

\emph{Claire holds her fork up to John.}

CLAIRE.  These are good.

JOHN.  Same as every week.

CLAIRE.  But this week, John, they're especially good.

MICHELLE.  Maybe it's the nuts.

CLAIRE.  It could be the nuts.  Oh, my god.  I don't know what it is, but John, this waffle has a quality \ldots that is just \ldots

\emph{Claire is squirming in her chair.}

CLAIRE.  Oh!  Fucking awesome.

MICHELLE.  Claire?

CLAIRE.  Mom, can you pass me the syrup?

MICHELLE.  Breakfast conversation?

CLAIRE.  Sorry but these are great.  I couldn't help it.  I mean god damn.  Sorry mom.  This is fucking the best waffle I've ever had.

JOHN.  Glad you like them.

MICHELLE.  That is awful, about that woman at the mall.  But at least she didn't get hurt.

CLAIRE.  Yeah.

MICHELLE.  Did they ever find the guy?

CLAIRE.  They're not looking for him.

MICHELLE.  Why not?

CLAIRE.  He didn't do anything.  It's not a crime to help somebody change a tire.  Or to leave your briefcase filled with Dr.  Death tools inside the trunk of somebody's car.

MICHELLE.  But surely he had intentions of doing the woman harm.

CLAIRE.  Probably.  But bad intentions aren't a crime.  It's not a crime to want to kill someone.  You have to actually do it.  They couldn't even get this guy on attempted murder.

JOHN.  Just changing a tire.

CLAIRE.  Yeah.  He never got the chance to attempt, thank god.

MICHELLE.  Thank god that woman had her wits about her.

CLAIRE.  You can't trust anybody these days.

\emph{Claire takes a big bite.}

CLAIRE.  Mmm.  John, I want you to know that I am finding this waffle to be extraordinary.  This waffle is like \ldots what is this waffle like?  The texture evokes \ldots I'm having deja-vu here, I'm having \ldots what is it called \ldots an epiphany \ldots no \ldots a revolution \ldots surging \ldots crescendo \ldots ummmmmm \ldots!

\emph{Claire is squirming in enjoyment.  She suddenly pushes her chair out, stands up.}

CLAIRE.  I've had enough.  I can't take it anymore.  I'll be in my room.

\emph{Claire exits.}

MICHELLE.  What was that all about?

JOHN.  No idea.

\section*{Scene 10}

\emph{Claire sits in her room watching Tom and Jerry.  The door opens, and John bursts in.}

JOHN.  What was that?

CLAIRE.  That was fun.  You did good.  You can be my toe man anytime.

JOHN.  What was all the mmm-ing and oh-ing and the fucking awesome waffles?  What are you trying to do?  She knows something's up.

CLAIRE.  No she doesn't.

JOHN.  How could she not, after that?!

CLAIRE.  Relax, John Lorenz, you're overreacting.

\emph{John grabs her by the shoulders and throws her back on the bed.}

JOHN.  You and me are done!  You understand?  That's the end.  I'm not playing along anymore.

\emph{Claire laughs.}

CLAIRE.  Playing along?  Is that what you think you're doing?  You're not playing along.  You're doing what you have to do keep up.  You're trying to hold it together.  Trying not to let it come out.

JOHN.  From now on, there's not going to be anything to come out.  Understand?  No more quickies, no more toeing, no more Karo syrup.  Okay?

CLAIRE.  What if that's not okay?  What if I decide I want more Karo syrup, John Lorenz?

JOHN.  Get it from somebody else.

CLAIRE.  What if I want it from you, John Lorenz?

JOHN.  You can't have it from me.

CLAIRE.  I beg to differ.

JOHN.  You can't make people do things.

CLAIRE.  No.  But you can present people with choices.  That's what I've done for you in the past, John Lorenz.  I've never made you do things.  You have choices now.  You can choose to keep my Karo syrup and toeing options open, or you can choose for our little secret to come out.  No forcing.  Just choices.

JOHN.  She wouldn't believe you if you told her.

CLAIRE.  If I told her, you'd probably break down and admit it all.

JOHN.  I wouldn't.  I'd deny it all.

CLAIRE.  I would make it difficult for her to believe you.  For anyone to believe you.

JOHN.  They'd believe me over you, trust me.

CLAIRE.  That's not what I had in mind.

JOHN.  What did you have in mind?

CLAIRE.  Let me ask you a question.  When was the first time you started liking me?

JOHN.  When you stormed into Michelle's room, the first time I saw you.

CLAIRE.  And when did you decide that you wanted to fuck me?

JOHN.  The same day.  At breakfast.  When you took off your jeans in front of me while I was making waffles.

CLAIRE.  And when do you think that I decided that I was going to let you fuck me?  Think carefully, this is the hard one.  Was it before or after I stormed into my mom's room that one day?  Was it before or after I planted that dryer sheet that you now hold so dearly in the leg of my jeans?  Which do you think happened first : do you think I stormed into my mom's room to see the two of you fucking and then went to my bedroom to plant a dryer sheet in my jeans, or do you think I planted the dryer sheet first?  When do you think that was?  Five minutes before I stormed into my mom's room?  Ten?  How many days in advance do you think that decision had been made?  Was there any question that you would follow me upstairs when I Catholic-schoolgirled your sorry ass around the living room?  What do you think my odds were on that one?  One to twenty?  One to fifty?  Try more like--

JOHN.  What's your point?

CLAIRE.  My point, John Lorenz, is that if I had you worked out well enough to know that you would follow me upstairs that day, how could you possibly think that it comes as a surprise to me that you now want to end this bad enough that you're willing to suffer the accusations you know I can make without using any imagination \ldots do you think I'm not prepared for that?  Do you think you've caught me sleeping?

\emph{She opens her panty drawer.  Throws a pair at him, which he steps away from.  Then she pulls out a tape recorder, and presses play.  It is John's voice.  "I've been wanting you all week, Claire.  I've been wanting to fuck your pink little pussy.  I was hoping you'd show me your room.  I'm glad you did."}

JOHN.  Give me that.

\emph{He moves toward her; she backs away.}

CLAIRE.  I'll scream and she'll come upstairs.

\emph{John Lorenz backs away.}

CLAIRE.  Now go away, John Lorenz.  Go away.

\emph{He exits slowly.  He pulls the door to behind him.  The music from Tom and Jerry increases in volume.  The animation of Tom and Jerry is suddenly projected in simulcast on TVs all over the house.  Tom gets smashed, or trapped, or blown up.  The TVs switch to fuzz, with the loud fuzz noise, then blackness, silence.}

\section*{Scene 11}

\emph{Claire's room.  Claire is standing by her dresser.  John is sitting on Claire's bed, watching her.  Claire bends down, without moving her legs or bending her knees, to sift through her panty drawer.  The hem of her black dress rises to the base of her ass.  John is looking.  She pushes the drawer halfway in, swivels around.}

CLAIRE.  Were you looking at my ass, John Lorenz?

JOHN.  I was.

\emph{Claire swivels back around, pulls the drawer fully out.  She bends down the same way to sift some more.}

CLAIRE.  I can't find any panties.

JOHN.  You don't need any.

CLAIRE.  I can't go like this.

JOHN.  No one will care.

\emph{John reaches out to touch her ass, but she sees it.  She turns around, steps between his legs.  Her breasts are in his face.  He wraps his arms around her ass.  She jumps back.}

CLAIRE.  I didn't say you could touch me.

\emph{She bows her head to examine three pair of panties she is holding.  She selects one, holds it to John's face.  She caresses his lips and taunts his nose.  Then suddenly she snatches the panties away from his face.}

CLAIRE.  What did you think of those?

\emph{John closes his eyes and nods his head.  Claire puts a finger on his nose and pushes him backward onto her bed.}

CLAIRE.  Get up!  I didn't say you could lay on my bed!

\emph{John sits up.  She places her hands on his shoulders and shoves him back down.  One of her knees slides up beside him, then the other.  She rocks over him slowly, closes as if for a kiss but does not complete it, only passing steamy breaths across his neck.  She slides down on him, pressing her breasts around his dick.  She slides all the way off the bed, and stands up.}

CLAIRE.  It's time for you to go.  I have to get ready.

\emph{John gets up from the bed.  She turns him, with his shoulders, to be facing the door.}

CLAIRE.  Walk.

\emph{He does.  Claire is putting on a pair of black high-heels.  Claire goes to the door and opens it.  John walks out.}

JOHN.  Have a good time at your party.

CLAIRE.  I always have a good time at parties.  Bye.

\emph{She shuts the door.}

\section*{Scene 12}

\emph{Claire's bathroom.  Claire wearing a bathrobe, getting ready to take a shower.  Her shower is a full bathtub with a curtain that covers three sides; only the end which supports the shower head is against a wall.  She turns on the shower.  Steam begins to rise from the tub.  Claire sings to herself, a Mozart opera, as she prepares to bathe.  The door to the bathroom opens.  Claire stops singing.  Music starts on this interruption : Nine Inch Nails - Closer.  It is John.  He holds a length of rope in one hand, a hacksaw in the other.}

JOHN.  I thought you were going to a party.

CLAIRE.  What the fuck are you doing here?

\emph{Claire sees what he is holding.  She laughs at him.}

CLAIRE.  What's up with the hacksaw, freak?  In the story it's a butcher knife.

\emph{John puts the hacksaw down on the sink.}

JOHN.  You don't cut bone with a butcher knife.

\emph{Claire laughs.}

CLAIRE.  That's funny, John Lorenz.  You're funny, you know that?  \ldots  You like jokes, John Lorenz?  I like jokes.  You wanna hear my joke?

JOHN.  Sure.

CLAIRE.  Okay.  Little Red Riding Hood is carrying her basket of goodies through the woods to her grandmother's house, when she comes across this little piggy who's also walking through the woods.  The little piggy says, Little Red Riding Hood, turn back, the Big Bad Wolf is waiting for you at Grandmother's house, and when you get there he's gonna lift up your skirt and fuck the shit out of you.  Little Red Riding hood says, oh, don't worry about me, I'll be fine.  The little piggy says, okay, but be careful.  So Little Red Riding Hood continues on and before long she runs into a second little piggy.  And the second little piggy says, Little Red Riding Hood, turn back, the Big Bad Wolf is waiting for you at Grandmother's house, and when you get there he's gonna lift up your skirt and fuck the shit out of you.  Little Red Riding Hood says, oh, don't worry about me, I'll be fine.  The little piggy says, okay, but be careful.

\emph{Claire gets lipstick out of her makeup crate and applies it as she continues to tell the joke.}

CLAIRE.  So Little Red Riding Hood continues on and before long she runs into a third little piggy.  And the third little piggy says, Little Red Riding Hood, you better turn back, because the Big Bad Wolf is waiting for you at Grandmother's house, and when you get there he's gonna lift up your skirt and fuck the shit out of you.  Little Red Riding Hood says, look, little piggy, you don't need to worry about me, I'll be fine.  I'm a big girl, this isn't the first time I've been in the woods.  The third little piggy says, okay, but be careful.  So Little Red Riding Hood continues on, and she finally gets to Grandmother's house.  She goes in, and sure enough, there's the Big Bad Wolf.  He says, I'm glad you made it, Little Red Riding Hood, now lift up your skirt, because I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you.  Then Little Red Riding Hood pulls a gun out of her basket

\emph{Claire takes a gun from her makeup crate and points it at John's face.}

CLAIRE.  and points it at the Big Bad Wolf.  She says, no you're not, you're gonna eat me like the story says.

\emph{Claire motions with the gun for John to get on his knees.  He does.  Then John knocks the gun away and grabs her wrists.}

CLAIRE.  Let go of me!

\emph{They struggle.  He wrestles her to the floor.}

JOHN.  Not this time.

CLAIRE.  Stop!

\emph{He puts his hand over her mouth.  Her words are muffled.}

CLAIRE.  Stop it!  Stop it you fuck!  LET ME GO!!!

JOHN.  I don't think so, Claire Coghlan.

\emph{The music gets louder.  He keeps his hand over her mouth.  She tries to bite him, he forces her mouth shut with both hands.}

CLAIRE.  HELP!!!  HELP!!!

\emph{She slips out from underneath his grip.}

CLAIRE.  HELP!!!

\emph{He wrestles her to the tile, this time she is on her back.  Ultimately he kneels on her, pinning her legs with his shins, holding both her arms with one hand, and shoving a bar of soap in her mouth and holding it there.  She is solidly trapped, but he is completely occupied by detaining her.  One of her hands slips free.  She grabs his shirt collar and twists it to tighten around his neck.  Both of his hands rush to loosen this, and she upsets his balance, knocks him to the floor.  She gets up and hits him in the face, knocking him back into the sink stand.  He bleeds from this, and becomes still.  Claire slings herself over the edge of the bathtub; her lower half crumpled on the floor tile.  She pants, out of breath and energy.  Behind her, John gets up.  He wraps the rope around her neck, pins one end of it to the edge of the bathtub with his foot, and pulls the other end to kill.  The music cuts to silence on a beat; the light is instantly red; both actors freeze in time.  NIN's A Warm Place begins playing as the red fades to darkness.  The curtain closes, if there is one, and the house lights fade up.}

\section*{Scene 1}

\emph{There's a knock at the door.  An old woman opens it.  She is Felicity Glenrose.  A woman in her forties stands outside.  A child hides behind her dress.  They are Karen and Casey McDermott.  Karen's left hand is bandaged.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  What is it, honey?

KAREN.  I'm here \ldots for the interview.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  We spoke on the phone.  Come inside now.  I'll take your coat.

KAREN.  Thank you.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Who is this little one?

KAREN.  This is Casey.  Say hi.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  They can be shy at that age.  How old is she?

KAREN.  Six.

\emph{Casey looks from behind her mom at a retarded adult sitting on a stool blowing hot air on his face with an electric hairdryer.  This is Peter Glenrose.}

KAREN.  Casey don't stare.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  He likes when people look at him.  Peter, I'd like you to meet Karen \ldots and Casey.

PETER.  'lo Casey / 'lo Karen

MRS.  GLENROSE.  They're here for an interview.

\emph{Peter shuts off the hairdryer.}

PETER.  interview

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Yes, an interview.  Like the other day.  Please have a seat.  And, Casey, if you'd like, you're welcome to use any of the toys we have situated in those bins over there.  There're some blocks, or you're welcome to draw and Peter might even join you if you let him.  So, how did you hear about the position?

KAREN.  I saw your ad in the Times.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  And what was it particularly about this position that made you think it would be suitable?

KAREN.  There were---well we---I'm just looking for anything I can find.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I'm sorry.  I don't mean to grill you, I'm afraid I'm not very good at giving interviews.

KAREN.  No, you were fine, I just---I'm sorry---

MRS.  GLENROSE.  No, let's start things over, shall we?  Would you like a cup of coffee?

KAREN.  No, thank you.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Come now, a cup of decaf?

KAREN.  No, I'm fine.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Well I'm having one.  I was just pouring it when you came to the door.  Are you sure you won't have a cup?

KAREN.  No, I appreciate it, but---

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Alright, alright.  Casey, I see you found the blocks.  Peter favors the yellow ones \ldots those arched ones there?  He likes to make castles but even more he likes to knock them down.

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose goes to the kitchen.}

KAREN.  Casey.  Don't make a mess.

\emph{Peter climbs down from the stool.  Carrying the hair dryer with him, he goes to where Casey is stacking blocks on the floor.  Casey finds one of the yellow blocks that is arched and hands it to Peter.  He takes it with his free hand and stares at Casey.  Casey looks away and focuses on the blocks.  Peter watches her meticulously select block at a time from the pile and place it delicately into a developing structure.  After watching her for a moment, Peter cautiously ventures his block onto what Casey is building.  Casey lets him place it there but she taps it to make it less crooked once he has released it.  Peter stares at the little girl.  Casey hands him another block.  Mrs.  Glenrose comes back carrying two cups of coffee.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Just in case you change your mind.  I though I'd save myself a trip later on.  People get to talking, you know, and next thing you know it's middle of the afternoon.  I get the sun through those windows in the evening.  Where do you live, Karen?

KAREN.  We live in Washington Heights.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Where exactly?

KAREN.  One-hundred and fifty-sixth street.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  My other son teaches at Columbia.  What happened to your hand, sweetie?

CASEY.  We were in an accident.  Max didn't make it.

\emph{Karen chokes up.  She covers her face.  Mrs.  Glenrose puts her hand on Karen's arm.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Oh, I'm sorry for asking.  Dear.  We're not off to a very good start, are we?

PETER.  Max?

CASEY.  Max was my boyfriend.

PETER.  I have a boyfriend

CASEY.  What's his name?

PETER.  Max

MRS.  GLENROSE.  How about we just sit here and look out the window and I'll try not to say anything.

KAREN.  That's okay.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Well, no, no it's not.  Here I am trying to put you at ease and I can't help it but I keep saying the wrong things.

KAREN.  You're fine.  I'm just---I'm just a mess right now and I keep trying to pretend that everything is okay, put on a happy face, but you can only smile so much and everything \ldots everything \ldots

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Everything is not okay.

KAREN.  No.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Of course it's not.  Have a sip of this coffee.  Tell me what you think.

\emph{Karen takes a sip.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Not bad for decaf.

KAREN.  It's good.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  It's not good, but it will do.

KAREN.  No, it's fine.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I used to drink it every day.  My husband gave me such a hard time but I held my tongue.  He drank scotch.  Casey, does your mother let you drink scotch?

CASEY.  I've never had it.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  It tastes like gasoline, and now that you know what it tastes like, you won't have need to try it.

CASEY.  Max loves to drink scotch.  He likes the smell of gasoline.

KAREN.  Stop talking about Max, Casey, you know I don't like that.

CASEY.  Max already knows you don't like him.

PETER.  you don't like Max?

KAREN.  Casey \ldots

\emph{Casey puts her finger up to her pursed lips in a ``silence'' gesture.  She scowls at her mom.}

KAREN.  Max is her imaginary friend.

CASEY.  He's not imaginary.

KAREN.  Well, actually, he is imaginary.  She's been doing this for months.  I don't know if I need to take her to see someone or what.

\ldots

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Does Casey play with friends her age?

KAREN.  She had a little boyfriend.  His name was Max, but he died---

CASEY.  He's not dead.

\emph{Karen holds her breath and closes her eyes.  Then swallows and lets her breath out.}

KAREN.  He died \ldots

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose again puts her hand on Karen.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Well, you need the job \ldots

KAREN.  Yes.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  You'll have to live here, if you take it.  It's hard enough to get myself up and down these stairs, and he needs help getting in and out of the bath, making sure he eats.  We have an extra room on the third floor.  It's very dusty now.  And its not big.

\emph{Karen smiles at Mrs.  Glenrose.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  But it will do.

\emph{Casey and Peter's castle has grown tall.  Casey taps Peter on the leg and pantomimes that she is knocking down the castle.  Peter becomes excited.  He waits for Casey to knock down the castle and when she does not, he pantomimes to her a knocking-down-the-castle motion.}

CASEY.  You do it.

\emph{Peter points to himself.  Casey nods.  He knocks down the castle and bounces up and down on his knees.  He switches on the hairdryer and points it at Casey.  Her hair flies up and she closes her eyes.}

PETER.  Max is my boyfriend / Max is my boyfriend

\section*{Scene 2}

\emph{Casey is practicing her violin.  Karen is cutting slices of apple and handing them to Peter.  Mrs.  Glenrose is reading, and not openly paying attention to anyone in the room.}

KAREN.  Remember what Vaughn says about the way you hold your pinky.  There you go.  And it's not---E \ldots and A---flat and it's lightly \ldots prancing \ldots dah dah dah dah da \ldots good.

PETER.  beautiful

\emph{Casey stops and lowers the bow.}

CASEY.  Thank you.

KAREN.  Practice.

CASEY.  When are we going to Vaughn's house again?

KAREN.  Vaughn lives in California.

CASEY.  I miss him.

KAREN.  So do I, Case.

\emph{Casey starts playing again.  She sightreads from a book.  Her mother turns the page when it's time.}

CASEY.  Why is my hair a different color than yours?

KAREN.  What do you mean?

CASEY.  Mine is lighter than yours and we're in the same family.

KAREN.  Even in the same family, people's hair can be different colors.

CASEY.  At school, there's this girl named Kristen.  She has red hair and her mom has red hair and both her brothers have red hair.

KAREN.  Sometimes people's hair is the same color and sometimes its different.

CASEY.  Why is ours different?

PETER.  why is our hair different colors?

CASEY.  Yes, that's right.  Why is our hair different colors?  Peter's hair is brown and Mrs.  Glenrose's hair is white.

KAREN.  Casey!

CASEY.  It is.  And they're in the same family.  Was I adopted?

KAREN.  Keep practicing.

CASEY.  Was I?

KAREN.  No.  Keep practicing.

\emph{Casey starts playing.  She plays for a while, then stops.}

CASEY.  We need to go shopping for new clothes for me.

KAREN.  Oh yeah?

CASEY.  I need a black dress.

KAREN.  Pray tell, why?

CASEY.  What does pray tell mean?

KAREN.  It means please.

CASEY.  Please tell.  Because I need a black dress for when I do recitals.

KAREN.  Girls who don't practice don't get to do recitals.

CASEY.  I am practicing.

\emph{She plays a few more notes of the song.  She leaves the book behind and dances around the room as though she were at a ball.  She continues playing while she dances.  Her playing and speaking are interleaved.}

CASEY.  I will have a black dress that is very long and very black with no sequins or anything shiny.  This will all be very formal and my hair will be dyed to match your color exactly and it will be pulled back in a very tight bun that will stretch the hair on the side of my head and stretch my face and my eyes back to the sides and I will have brown eyeliner like yours and as I cascade into the ballroom I will dip my knees to the audience \ldots

\emph{Casey courtseys to Mrs.  Glenrose.}

CASEY.  \ldots and they will smile at me from behind their programs and then I will play for them the most beautiful recital \ldots

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose claps.}

KAREN.  And how will you know what to play at this recital if you haven't practiced?

CASEY.  I'm practicing.

\emph{She starts playing.  After a moment she stops and looks at her mother, who at the silence has already raised turned to her daughter.}

CASEY.  What does cascade mean?

KAREN.  It means to fall or flow down in a beautiful way.

CASEY.  Because they have commercials for it on TV and it means something else.

KAREN.  It's also dish soap.

CASEY.  I thought it was dish soap.  But I thought it would be nice for the audience if I could cascade into the ballroom.

PETER.  you can cascade into the ballroom

CASEY.  Thank you.  I think I might.  Will you come see my recital?

PETER.  yes / yes I will see your recital

\emph{Karen points to the music practice book.  Casey restores her playing posture.  She shoots a glance at Peter.}

CASEY.  I'll get you a free ticket.

\emph{Casey winks and starts playing again.  Mrs.  Glenrose closes her book and goes to the table.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Come with me Peter.

KAREN.  I can watch him.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  You've watched him all day and I'm almost through my book, so thank you, but he'll come with me for a while and you can rest.  Come on.

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose heads out of the room with her son.  Peter goes first.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Go on up, dear.  I'll meet you at the top.

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose goes back into the kitchen and fishes on top of the refrigerator.  There are flats of Coke there and she takes a can.}

KAREN.  I've set you up with a new teacher here---

CASEY.  But I want Vaughn!

KAREN.  I know you loved Vaughn.  Vaughn loves you, too.  Do you want to call him on the telephone later?

\emph{Casey nods.}

KAREN.  We'll do that.  But tomorrow you have a lesson with Alex French.  I know he's not Vaughn, but I'd like you to go and see if you can get along with him just well enough for him to teach you.

CASEY.  Alex French?  Is he really French?

KAREN.  No, but he's excellent.  He's so good, Casey, I think you'll like him.

CASEY.  He's not as good as Vaughn.

KAREN.  Unfortunately, Vaughn's in California.

CASEY.  We should have brought him with us.

KAREN.  We can ask him tonight if he'd like to move here.

CASEY.  And he can live with us in the attic?

KAREN.  If he says yes, we can ask Mrs.  Glenrose.

CASEY.  If he says no?

KAREN.  Then you're stuck with Alex French.

CASEY.  I don't want to be stuck with Alex French.

KAREN.  You can learn from him.

CASEY.  I like it when you teach me.

KAREN.  I can't teach you now.  You need someone who can take you farther.  You want that, don't you?

\emph{Casey nods.}

KAREN.  Well, you'll see, Alex French can make you into the best violinist you can possibly be.  You want to be a good violinist, don't you?  You want to play recitals?

CASEY.  I want to play---

KAREN.  Then you will.

CASEY.  I want to play like you do.

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose has been going toward the door but she falters in her step.  Karen looks at her bandaged hand.}

\section*{Scene 3}

\emph{Casey and Peter are playing.  The adults are elsewhere.}

CASEY.  Who do you want to be, the owl or the pussycat?

PETER.  I want to be the owl

CASEY.  Okay, you will be the owl and I will be the pussycat.  This is the rehearsal for our play.  Tonight will be our opening night.  This is the dress rehearsal.  We have to practice so that we'll know all our lines.  Have you ever been in a play before?

PETER.  no I've never been in a play before

CASEY.  You'll do fine.  As long as you learn your lines and pay attention during rehearsal, you'll know exactly what to do.  Are you nervous?

PETER.  about the people going to see me?

CASEY.  Yes, the audience.

PETER.  all the people in their seats looking at us with the programs?

CASEY.  Right.  The people with the programs.  You won't be able to see them because of the footlighting.  Do you know what footlighting is?

\emph{Peter is confused and made uncomfortable by this question.  Casey puts her arm around him and shows him around their stage.}

CASEY.  I'll tell you.  The footlighting is downstage, at the front.  The back of the stage is called upstage and the front part near the \ldots audience \ldots is called downstage.  We're downstage now.  These are the footlights.  They come in different colors, red, white, and blue, and when you want everything to be bright you turn them all on and they mix together to make white.  So when we're singing, they're going to turn on all the lights on us?

PETER.  they're going to see us in the bright lights?

CASEY.  Yes, it's okay, you can touch them \ldots see \ldots they're not hot right now.  But once they turn on you can't touch them cause they get very hot.

PETER.  this is a red one

CASEY.  Yes!  And this \ldots is a white one.

PETER.  this is another red one

CASEY.  No, that one's blue.

PETER.  this is a blue one

CASEY.  Right.  They go, red, white, blue all the way across.

PETER.  and they mix together?

CASEY.  They all mix together to make white.  But if you turn off just the white ones then the red and blue mix together to make purple.

PETER.  I like the blue one

CASEY.  Oh!  Be careful, they just turned them on!

PETER.  and they're hot!

CASEY.  Let's go over here so we don't burn ourselves.

PETER.  the blue

CASEY.  But later on, you'll have a solo and we'll turn on only the blue ones for you to sing in.  Have you been practicing your solo?

PETER.  I've never singed solo before

CASEY.  I'll teach you.  Have a seat.  Now, I'll be Vaughn.  And you're here for your lesson.  You say, "Good morning, Mr.  Goggins."

PETER.  good morning Mr.  Goggins thank you

CASEY.  Just good morning will do.  Vaughn doesn't like it if you add extra words to things.  Now, Peter, have you practiced your solo?

PETER.  I haven't practiced my solo

CASEY.  You haven't practiced!  What have you been doing?

PETER.  what?

CASEY.  Instead of practicing your solo?  What's been keeping you from your studies?

PETER.  I am keeping me / from my studies

CASEY.  Let's hear from one of our other students.  Max, how is your solo coming?  Oh, excellent!  Is that what I heard you practicing in your room this morning?  No, I couldn't hear it clearly, would you play it for us now?  Thank you, Max.

\emph{Casey makes room at the front of the classroom.  Max comes up to the front and plays his solo.  Casey folds her arms and listens to the music.}

CASEY.  Max, that was excellent.  Thank you very much.

PETER.  max was excellent / you're my excellent boyfriend

CASEY.  No!  Actually Max can't be your boyfriend.  Max already has a girlfriend.

PETER.  Max does not have a girlfriend

CASEY.  How long have you known Max?  I've known him since I was born and I happen to know that he does have a girlfriend.

PETER.  how do you know?

CASEY.  Because I am Max's girlfriend.  You can still be his friend but he can't have both a boyfriend and a girlfriend at the same time.  Understand?

PETER.  yes I understand

CASEY.  Now.  How's your solo coming?  Peter!  How's your solo coming?

\emph{Peter distresses.}

PETER.  I don't have a solo

CASEY.  Peter.  Peter, not in the game.  It's okay, that class is over.  We're not in the game anymore.

PETER.  you're not Mr.  Goggins?

CASEY.  No.  I'm Casey.  Mr.  Goggins went home to be with his family.

PETER.  game is over?

CASEY.  Yep.  Now we're just sitting here twiddling our thumbs.  Peter, keep twiddling!

\emph{She shows him how.  He does it, and it puts his mind at ease.  Casey twiddles as though she is being watched.}

CASEY.  Just twiddling all the live long day.

PETER.  twiddling all the day?

CASEY.  Yes.  Just like John Henry.

PETER.  and Max!

CASEY.  No.  Max isn't here right now.

PETER.  why not?

CASEY.  Because.  Sometimes he needs a break from you.

\emph{They just sit for a moment.  Then Peter says:}

PETER.  I miss Max

\emph{Casey sighs.}

CASEY.  Well, if you miss him that much \ldots we can go visit him if we hurry.

PETER.  why do we have to hurry?

CASEY.  Because he won't be there long.

PETER.  where is he?

CASEY.  He's at the hospital.  We'll have to drive if we want to get there in time.  Come on!  Get in!

\emph{Buckle your seatbelt.}

Casey buckles her own.  Peter is confused.

CASEY.  Here.

\emph{She buckles it for him and steps on the gas.  She makes car screeching noises.}

PETER.  why are we going so fast?

CASEY.  Because we have to get there in time.

PETER.  people get in accidents

CASEY.  Don't you think I know that, Peter?  But sometimes people need to drive fast because they need to get someplace in a hurry and we don't always do the smartest things when we're not thinking clearly we sometimes do things we regret later!

\emph{Casey is out of the car.  Peter gets up but Casey screams at him.}

CASEY.  No Peter it's too late!  We didn't make it on time!  We didn't make it!

\emph{Peter is mortified.}

PETER.  to see Max \ldots?

\emph{Casey sees Peter's state.  It calms her.  She proceeds matter-of-factly.}

CASEY.  Max is dead now.  We didn't make it on time.

\emph{Karen comes into the room.}

KAREN.  What are you screaming about!?

PETER.  max is dead now

CASEY.  We were playing car and Peter didn't put his seatbelt on fast enough.

KAREN.  Okay.  Time for a different game.

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose comes into the room.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Is everything alright?

KAREN.  Just a pretend game that's gotten a little out of hand.  Maybe you and Peter can play seperately for a while.

CASEY.  That's fine with me.

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose speaks to Casey:}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Would you like to take a walk?

\emph{Karen speaks to Peter:}

KAREN.  Ready for a different game?

\emph{Casey shakes her head.  Peter looks at Casey from across the room, then looks at the floor.}

PETER.  painting

KAREN.  Sure, we can paint.  I wish you would be a little nicer to him.

CASEY.  He didn't put on his seatbelt.

PETER.  red white and blue colors

CASEY.  That's right.  Like the footlights.

\emph{Karen moves toward her daughter.  Peter stands up and fishes around on a high shelf for the painting supplies.}

KAREN.  You can be more patient with him.

CASEY.  Some things have to be done quickly.

KAREN.  But it's important that you go easy with him.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Oh, he can take it.

KAREN.  But I wish she'd be nicer.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  It's tough for both of them.  They do pretty well.

KAREN.  I feel awful, though \ldots

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Don't worry about it so much.  He's gotten much worse from me on my bad days.  You're sure you wouldn't enjoy a short walk?

CASEY.  Not right now.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Maybe later, then.

CASEY.  Maybe.

\emph{Karen sees that Peter is struggling to retrieve the painting supplies.  She rushes over to him to help \ldots}

KAREN.  Oh, Peter \ldots

\emph{\ldots but she's too late.  He pulls the painting box off the shelf and it crashes onto the floor.  Brushes scatter everywhere.  A can of blue paint comes open when it hits the floor.  Blue splatters over the floor, the furniture, and Peter.  Karen is shocked.  Mrs.  Glenrose chuckles.}

KAREN.  Oh, no!

MRS.  GLENROSE.  It's fine \ldots

KAREN.  I should have gotten it down for him first before I started--

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Dear, it's of little consequence.  He wanted to paint \ldots

\emph{Peter is rubbing the paint into the floor with his fingers.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  \ldots and now he's painting.

KAREN.  I'll clean this up---

MRS.  GLENROSE.  No!  We'll clean up after he's done.

KAREN.  I should learn to keep a better eye on him.  I should---

MRS.  GLENROSE.  You should get me a Coke.  And take a short walk with me, if Casey won't.

\emph{Casey looks up at Mrs.  Glenrose to see if she's mad.  The old woman isn't mad.  She shrugs innocently at the child.  Karen is getting a Coke from the top of the refrigerator.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Would you like to take a walk, child?

CASEY.  I'd like to stay here and paint.

\emph{Casey and her mom pass each other on their way across the room, Casey going toward Peter, Karen going toward Mrs.  Glenrose.  Casey tentatively enters Peter's playspace.  He takes her hand and puts it in the paint.  Karen helps Mrs.  Glenrose put on a sweater, then opens the Coke for her and puts it in her hand.  The women are on their way out when Mrs.  Glenrose stops and turns to speak to her son.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  What did you learn today, Peter?

\emph{Peter looks at his mother.}

PETER.  today I learned all about blue

\section*{Scene 4}

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose is reading on the couch.  Peter is not around.  Karen and Casey are walking toward the outside door.  Casey stops walking.}

KAREN.  What's wrong?

CASEY.  I'm not going.

KAREN.  What do you mean you're not going?

CASEY.  I am not going.

KAREN.  Casey.  You have to be there in twenty minutes.

\ldots

KAREN.  Is he that bad?

\emph{Casey nods.}

KAREN.  He can't be that bad.  He's the best teacher in the city.

CASEY.  He's not nice.

KAREN.  What's not nice about him?

CASEY.  Vaughn was nice.

KAREN.  Vaughn?  I seem to remember Vaughn could get not-so-nice sometimes.

CASEY.  He was nice most of the time.

KAREN.  Vaughn is in California.  Alex French is in New York, and he's expecting you for a lesson in \ldots nineteen minutes.  Are we gonna be there?

CASEY.  No.

KAREN.  Case!  Every day it's this battle with you.  I got you the best teacher I could find and he's not Vaughn, of course, but it's the best I can do.  Maybe you don't really want to play the violin.

CASEY.  I do.

KAREN.  Then show me by not putting up such a stink when I'm taking you to your lesson.

\emph{Casey freaks out.}

CASEY.  I'm not putting up a stink!

KAREN.  Casey, quiet!

\emph{Casey puts her fingers in her ears and screams.}

KAREN.  Casey, Mrs.  Glenrose is trying to read.

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose makes a ``forget about it'' motion and turns the page.  Casey plants herself on the floor.}

KAREN.  We have \ldots eighteen minutes to get you to your lesson.

\emph{Karen waits.  Casey doesn't move.}

KAREN.  If we have to take a cab I'm taking it out of your allowance.

CASEY.  Mom!

KAREN.  Well, what do you want me to do?  We still have time if we hurry.

CASEY.  I don't like hurrying.

KAREN.  Then you need to get ready earlier next time.

\ldots

KAREN.  We have three minutes before we have to take a cab.

CASEY.  I don't like cabs.

KAREN.  If we leave right now you don't have to.  But only if we leave right now.

\emph{Casey doesn't move.  Karen goes to the table and sits.  There is a long moment when nobody talks.  Karen starts making coffee.  Casey opens her violin case and takes out her instrument.  She plucks the strings.  Mrs.  Glenrose continues to read.  Karen accepts that they are not going to the lesson.  She calms.  She goes gently to her daughter.}

KAREN.  You don't have to go if you don't want to.

\emph{Casey gently ignores her, continuing to pluck at her instrument.  Karen goes back to the table and stands with her back to the room.  Casey gathers her things and leaves to go upstairs.  She accidentally leaves behind her practice book.  Karen sits at the table.  Mrs.  Glenrose puts down her book and goes to sit by Karen.  They have their moment, then Karen says:}

KAREN.  She used to beg me to see Vaughn.  On days she didn't even have lessons I would find her standing by the door with her case, ready to go.

\ldots

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I think she misses Max.

\emph{Karen clenches her eyes and bows her head.  Then she really starts to cry, and, keeping it as much to herself as possible, she covers her face with her hands.  Ultimately she lays her head on her crossed arms on the table.  Mrs.  Glenrose sits quietly, thinking, and then goes to the couch and takes one of the decorative pillows and brings it back to the table.  She lifts Karen's head and puts the pillow underneath.  Then she goes pours cups of coffee for both Karen and herself, placing them on the table.  Karen is still laying on the table.  Mrs.  Glenrose does not drink from her cup.  In a moment, Casey comes back into the room, looking around for what she's lost.  Her violin and bow are in hand.  She sees the practice book lying on the floor and goes to pick it up.  She puts the bow under the arm that is holding her violin and takes the book with her other hand.  She starts to leave again but Mrs.  Glenrose stops her:}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Child \ldots come here.

\emph{Casey stops and goes to the old woman, who scoots her chair back from the table.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Give me that thing.

\emph{Casey hands the woman the child-sized violin.  Mrs.  Glenrose takes the bow from her as well.  The rests the instrument on her shoulder and holds the bow above the strings.  Her movement is halting, arthritic, painful to watch.  She closes her eyes and starts to play.  Its first note raises Karen's head and strikes fear into Casey's eyes.  The old woman's arms lose their frailty.  All softness in her face drops away as the expert shrieking of her music wrapts the small audience.  It is a stark improvisation, momentary, longing, gone.  When she is finished she hands the violin back to the child.  Casey's eyes never leave the old woman.  Casey places the violin on the table.  She pulls a chair over until it is next to the old woman.  She takes her violin from the table and sits in the chair.  She sits up straight.  She looks earnestly at Felicity Glenrose.}

CASEY.  I want you to be my teacher.

\section*{Scene 5}

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose and her son are in the room.  Peter plays with blocks on the floor and Mrs.  Glenrose cleans the house around him.}

PETER.  where's Casey?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Casey and her mother have gone out for a while.

PETER.  where have they gone out to?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I don't know, exactly.  I think it's good for them to see the city, though.

PETER.  where did they go?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Well, I'm not sure.  They may have gone shopping.

PETER.  clothes shopping?  / member clothes shopping?  / we went clothes shopping?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Of course I remember.  How could I forget?  We had such fun last time we went out.  I could use some sun myself.

PETER.  I like the yellow lemonade

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I like the pink lemonade.  Shall we go out later and get some lemonade?

PETER.  with Garland

MRS.  GLENROSE.  And we'll say hello to Garland.

PETER.  I miss Casey

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Oh, I know you do.  You have such a good playmate in her.

PETER.  she's pretty

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Do you think so?  Well, she's too young for you.

PETER.  she's not too young / she is six years old

MRS.  GLENROSE.  How old are you, I forgot \ldots

PETER.  you forgot how old I am?!  / you can't forget how old I am!

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I didn't forget, I'm just teasing.

PETER.  don't tease about my birthday / I scares

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Okay, I'm sorry.

PETER.  how old am I?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  You're thirty-eight.

PETER.  I am not thirty-eight I'm thirty-nine

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Well, I must have missed your birthday---

PETER.  you missed my birthday too?!  / we missed my birthday presents!  / you forgot how old I am and missed my birthday

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I didn't miss your birthday.  You're thirty-eight and we haven't skipped a party the entire time.

PETER.  you skipped my party?!

MRS.  GLENROSE.  We haven't skipped a party.  We've had thirty-eight parties for thirty-eight years.  Every year we have a party.

PETER.  every year like the trampoline

MRS.  GLENROSE.  What--?  No, last year you got a tape recorder.

PETER.  I wanted a trampoline

MRS.  GLENROSE.  You'll hurt yourself with a trampoline.

PETER.  I hurt myself with the tape recorder

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose chuckles.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  You'd hurt yourself worse with a trampoline.

PETER.  I won't hurt myself with a trampoline

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Well.

\ldots

PETER.  next year I want a trampoline

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I wouldn't hold my breath.

PETER.  why not you hold your breath?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I mean I wouldn't wait around forever.

PETER.  what you waiting for?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I'm encouraging you not to wait around for a trampoline.

PETER.  no I don't want to wait

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Exactly.

PETER.  ready for our lemonades party?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  It's not going to be a lemonade party, it's just going to be a lemonade walk, alright?

PETER.  I want a party

MRS.  GLENROSE.  You can pretend we're having a party.

\emph{Peter knocks down his block castle.}

PETER.  don't want to pretend!

\emph{He crosses his arms in front of his head.  Mrs.  Glenrose continues with her cleaning.  Peter pokes an eye out from behind his arms, watching her.  He hides again.  He takes a fuller look at her, then crawls across the floor to the shelf where the toys and painting supplies are.  He takes item after item from the shelves and throws them into the room.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Peter!  Stop!  \ldots  Peter!  Come now, what's the matter?!  \ldots  Listen, Peter, when we have disagreements it isn't necessary for you to begin throwing things.  Can't you see I've been tidying up?  \ldots  Peter?

\emph{Peter thows something that hits his mother.  She halts in her approach, sits at the table.  She begins to cry.  Peter throws a few more things but is disturbed by her crying.  Gradually he calms and approaches her.}

PETER.  Mom you okay?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  No.

PETER.  why you not okay?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  You're upsetting me.

PETER.  what's upsetting you?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Your throwing things.  It scares me.  You scare me sometimes, Peter.

PETER.  I can not scare you

MRS.  GLENROSE.  You do scare me.  You're scaring me right now.

\emph{This pushes Peter over the edge.}

PETER.  I'm not scaring you!

MRS.  GLENROSE.  You frighten me in my own home!  I don't feel safe from you sometimes.  You're hurting me, Peter

PETER.  I'm hurting you by throwing things \ldots?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Yes, by throwing things!  You hit me and now I'm hurting!

PETER.  I didn't mean to hit you!

MRS.  GLENROSE.  It doesn't matter, you hit me anyway.  You can't do that, Peter.  I'm too fragile for it.

PETER.  fragile?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I'm delicate, Peter.  You have to be gentle with me or else you hurt me.

PETER.  I'm sorry I wasn't gentle!

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Well remember that the next time you want to throw things.

PETER.  I won't throw things!

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I would appreciate it if you wouldn't.

PETER.  I won't!  / I'm sorry I did it / you okay?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  No, I'm bruised.  You see that?

\emph{As she says "You see that?" she forces her arm in Peter's face in a way that startles him.}

PETER.  I see I'm sorry / oh I'm sorry Mom I'm sorry I hurt you

\emph{She won't talk to him.  Peter sulks.  The old woman gets up and stands at the sink with her back to her son.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Peter.  It's time to play our game.

\ldots

PETER.  I don't want to play our game today

MRS.  GLENROSE.  You hurt me.  You made me feel bad.

\emph{The old woman waits.  Peter struggles, in his own way, with what he's about to do.  He stands up.  He takes his pants off.}

PETER.  you want to feel good now?

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose turns around and looks at her son.  She motions to him to come close to her.}

PETER.  can I have yellow lemonade later?

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose nods.  Peter goes to her.  She touches his penis.  The outside door opens and Casey walks in, holding a shopping bag.  She sees what the old woman is doing.  She drops the shopping bag.  Mrs.  Glenrose hears this sound and sees that Casey is there.  The old woman points to the door that leads upstairs.  Peter gets his pants and goes upstairs.  Mrs.  Glenrose follows.  Casey is staring, shocked to stillness, when her mother comes in the house behind her.  Karen goes past her daughter into the kitchen, talking.}

KAREN.  We'll have to hit the market next time.  I'm starving.  Are you starving?  Remember those ginger muffins?  Those looked sooo good.  I bet we could make those here if we wanted to.  All you'd need to know is what spices they put in them?  Did you smell them?  They definitely had ginger, and cinnamon.  I think I smelled cardamom---

\emph{Karen has put her bags down and seen her daughter standing shocked in the doorway.}

KAREN.  Case.  What's wrong?

\section*{Scene 6}

\emph{Peter is in the bathtub.  The door is ajar.  Someone walks by on the outside.}

PETER.  hello?

\emph{The person comes back and peeks into the bathroom.}

CASEY.  Hello?

PETER.  hey Casey it's Peter what you doing now?

CASEY.  I'm going for a snack.

PETER.  what's in your snack?

CASEY.  A sandwich.

PETER.  what you having to drink?

CASEY.  I don't know \ldots

PETER.  you have to have a drink with your snack / what kind of drink you having?

PETER.  Coke

CASEY.  I'll bring you some water.

PETER.  no!  / I want to bring Coke!

CASEY.  Shhh!  If I bring you Coke you have to be quiet about it.

PETER.  our little secret?

CASEY.  Yes.

PETER.  Casey?

\emph{Peter waits for her response but none comes.  He sings and talks to himself, trying to be quiet about the Coke part.}

PETER.  I get Coke / I get Coke / Casey is bringing Coke for me to drink / Casey has the Coke and a sandwich in a can for me / Coke is in a can with fizz / Casey has a sandwich for her snack / and I have Coke to drink / my bathtub will have a Coke / this is our little secret / between Casey and me / we have a secret that is a private times / Coke feels good / Coke feels good in my mouth in a bathtub and secret time / friendly Casey / Casey is friendly / my friend is Casey with the beautiful beautiful hair and tied in a knot / Casey is my friendly girl and Casey likes the blue paint too and Casey on the way to get a snack in the bathtub sandwich / sandwich time / sandwich time / we have our sandwich time in the bathtub room and Casey is the beautiful beautiful Casey and she plays the violin!  / Casey, Casey / playing the violin / she is my baby and violin girl!  / she is my friend / she is my baby / she is a little little baby and I am her dad / she is a beautiful little baby I am her dad / I am her dad / I am her dad / she is the beautiful violet musical sound / violet violin / violet sound

\emph{His song becomes a chant.}

PETER.  and when do we get the Coke?  / and when do we get the Coke?  / Coke is my favorite drink / when do we get to drink the Coke in my bathing room / in my bathing room / Casey will come in the room / Casey will come in the bath / when will you come into the room with Coke and with your snackwich?  / snackwich, snackwich / I have a bite of your snackwich / can I feel good in the bath with a sandwich / where is my Coke and my sandwich?  / Casey little daughter where are you?  / Casey?  / Casey can you hear me?  / Casey I want the lemonade!

\emph{The door opens.  It is Casey.}

CASEY.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?

PETER.  I miss you Casey

\emph{The children hear their parents voices.}

KAREN.  What is going on in there?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  What's the matter?

KAREN.  It sounded like he fell.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  I suspect he's grown lonely.

\emph{The parents' voices get louder.  Casey flips the latch on the door.}

KAREN.  Peter, what's wrong?

\emph{They try the door.  Casey and Peter see it wiggle from inside.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Unlock this door.

PETER.  fine I'm fine

KAREN.  Let us in, Peter.  Are you okay?

PETER.  fine!

KAREN.  Did you fall?  \ldots  Did you fall?

PETER.  I did fall no / no / I'm fine in here alone

PETER.  fine fine

MRS.  GLENROSE.  He's fine.  Let's let him alone for now, he needs time to himself.

KAREN.  I'm worried about him.

MRS.  GLENROSE.  He gives me such a start sometimes \ldots

\emph{As the parents voices grow quieter, Casey tiptoes away from the door.  She sits on the toilet.  She balances her plate on the edge of the tub.  There is a Coke under her arm.  She takes it out, opens it, and gives it to Peter.}

PETER.  thank you thank you

CASEY.  Shhh \ldots

\emph{He says it more quietly:}

PETER.  thank you thank you

CASEY.  You're welcome.

\emph{Casey takes a bite of her sandwich.}

PETER.  your sandwich?

CASEY.  I put cheese on it.

\emph{She holds it out for him to take a bite.}

PETER.  you put cheese on your sandwich?

CASEY.  And peanut butter.

PETER.  you put cheese with peanut butter?

\emph{She holds it for him.  He shakes his head.}

CASEY.  It's good.  Try it.

\emph{He won't try it.  Casey shrugs her shoulders.}

PETER.  okay okay

\emph{She gives him a bite.  He smiles.  He takes another bite from her and holds his head back with his mouth open.  He pours in some Coke.  Some gets on his face.  He sloshes it all around and swallows it.  It takes some effort.}

PETER.  it's good all together

CASEY.  That stuff makes me burp.

PETER.  it makes me burp too / sometimes when I burp it hurts

\emph{He takes a huge gulp of the drink.}

CASEY.  If you drink slowly it won't hurt as much.

PETER.  no / I like how it tastes

CASEY.  Can I have a sip?

PETER.  your mom says you're not allowed

\emph{Casey begins to reproach him.}

PETER.  just teasing / teasing, Casey / here / you like that taste?

CASEY.  Yeah.

PETER.  let's give Max a taste / does Max like Coke?

\emph{Casey nods.  Peter gives invisible Max a taste of the Coke.  It falls through his body into the bathwater.}

CASEY.  Not too much!

PETER.  sorry

CASEY.  He won't be able to sleep.

PETER.  I didn't give him too much

CASEY.  He can have a little.  But no more.  No!  No more, Peter!

PETER.  don't want him to be awake all night

CASEY.  He has to wake up early.

PETER.  for a recital?

CASEY.  No.

PETER.  he can play his recital for us now?

CASEY.  He doesn't want to right now.

PETER.  why not

CASEY.  He's tired of practicing.

PETER.  he has to practice if he wants to be good

CASEY.  He already practiced today.

PETER.  he can play a little song for us in the bath?

CASEY.  He doesn't like to play in the bath.

PETER.  because the instrument

CASEY.  Can't get wet.

PETER.  I know / maybe later

CASEY.  Well \ldots

PETER.  he can play his recital in the hallway / does he want a bite of your sandwich?

CASEY.  No, he---

PETER.  maybe he wants some more Coke

CASEY.  Max is---

PETER.  maybe he wants decaf

CASEY.  He doesn't drink decaf.  Max is tired.  He wants to go to sleep.

PETER.  because he's tired

CASEY.  Max is very, very tired now.  He's had a big day.

PETER.  and he's ready for night now?

CASEY.  Actually---

PETER.  and he needs to sleep till noon

CASEY.  No, actually---

PETER.  and he's very tired---

CASEY.  Peter.  Max is going on a trip.

PETER.  he's---

CASEY.  He's taking a trip.  And he'll be on a boat.  And he's going away for a long time.

PETER.  how long

CASEY.  Several years.

PETER.  we can visit him where he's gone---

CASEY.  No.  He's too far away.  We can't visit him.

PETER.  is he going to play his recital

CASEY.  He's going to play his recital for someone else.

PETER.  he doesn't like us---

CASEY.  He likes us.  But he has to play on the other side of the ocean now.  He's taking a boat to the other side of the ocean.  Right now he's in a storm and the waves are rocking his boat so much he's afraid he'll fall out into the water and sharks will eat him

PETER.  he!---

CASEY.  He's afraid of that, but that won't happen.

PETER.  the sharks won't eat him

CASEY.  No.  His boat will go through the storm and when he gets to the other side of the ocean the waves will lie down and his boat will slide into the sand on the beach and \ldots everything \ldots will be \ldots very \ldots quiet \ldots he'll wake up \ldots and he'll pick up a seashell and use it to drink from the ocean \ldots then he'll take out his violin and he'll stand at the ocean and play his recital \ldots and his music will float across the water, all the way through the calm and all the way through the storm to the beaches on this side of the ocean \ldots and we'll be able to hear it.

PETER.  then he'll come back to us?

\ldots

CASEY.  No.  He's not coming back.

\emph{Casey allows herself to feel this.  Peter understands.  He sits quietly.  Casey takes a bite of her sandwich and wipes her face with her arm.  Peter drinks the last sip of his Coke.  Casey gets up to leave.}

PETER.  I need to dry off

\emph{Casey hands Peter a towel.  He wipes part of his hair, then drops the towel in the water and picks up the hairdryer.  He fiddles with the switch.  Click.  Click.  It does nothing.  Casey is halfway out the door.}

PETER.  it's not working

\emph{Casey stops, turns around.  She sees Peter trying to use the hairdryer, but it's not plugged in.  She picks up the cord and moves it toward an electrical outlet.  The last two seconds of her movement are in slow motion.  When she plugs in the cord the stage lights go out and in the darkness there is an exaggerated sharp blue spark and its corresponding pop!  We hear the sound of Casey's sandwich plate hitting the tile floor.  Peter wails and gurgles.  Casey screams:}

CASEY.  Peter!  Peeeeeter!!!  Moaaaaaaaaaaam!!!!!  Moaaaaaaaaaaam!!!!!

\emph{As Casey is screaming, the lights flicker and come back on.  Mrs.  Glenrose has a key.  She and Karen scramble into the bathroom.}

KAREN.  Oh, Casey!  What happened!?  Oh, god!  Casey!  Get away from the plug!  Get back!  Back!  Fuck!  Oh \ldots!

\emph{Karen jerks the cord out of the wall.  Peter isn't moving.  Karen grabs Casey by the shoulders and shakes her.}

KAREN.  Casey!  I'll call 9-1-1.

\emph{Karen leaves the room.}

MRS.  GLENROSE.  Step away from the tub, dear.

\emph{Casey is too shocked to move.  Mrs.  Glenrose helps her aside, goes to the outlet, and re-inserts the electrical cord.}

CASEY.  He's dead?

MRS.  GLENROSE.  He never had a life.

\emph{Mrs.  Glenrose sits on the edge of the tub and lets herself fall backward.  Lights out.}

\section*{Scene 7}

\emph{There is no curtain call.  A lawyer reads the old woman's will with the house lights up as the audience leaves.  The lawyer doesn't have to read the whole thing, but the lawyer does have to read until everyone has left, or until the end of the text, whichever comes first.}

LAYWER.  I, FELICITY M.  GLENROSE, of the City, County and State of New York, do make, publish and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby revoking all wills and codicils at any time heretofore made by me.  I direct that there be no funeral service or memorial service of any kind for me and that I be buried at sea.  I give my eyes to THE EYE BANK FOR SIGHT RESTORATION INC., New York, New York, and I hereby ratify all that anyone theretofore may have done toward carrying out this gift.  I give and bequeath to my son PETER H.  GLENROSE, if he survives me, my Greek alabaster head of a woman if owned by me at the time of my death.  Except as hereinabove otherwise effectively bequeathed, I give and bequeath all my tangible personal property, including, without limitation, my collection of letters, papers and documents, my personal effects, my furniture, furnishings, rugs, pictures, books, silver, plate, linen, china, glassware, objects of art, wearing apparel, jewelry, automobiles and their accessories, and all other household goods owned by me at the time of my death to CASEY S.  MCDERMOTT and KAREN E.  MCDERMOTT, if they survive me, to be divided between them by my Executors, in the exercise of sole and absolute discretion, in as nearly equal portions as may be practicable, having due regard for the personal preferences of these two individuals.  I direct my Executors to set aside the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (\$500,000) for CASEY S.  MCDERMOTT, and I give and bequeath the sum so set aside to the Trustees hereinafter named, IN TRUST, NEVERTHELESS, to hold the same, and to manage, invest and reinvest the same, to collect the income thereof and to dispose of the net income and principal for the following uses and purposes and subject to the following terms and conditions:  1.  Payment of Annuity Amount.  The Trustees shall hold and manage the trust property for a term (the "trust term") which shall commence with the date of my death and shall end on the tenth (lOth) anniversary thereof.  At the end of each taxable year of the trust during the trust term (other than any short taxable year thereof for which specific provisions are hereinafter made), the Trustees shall pay over to such organization or organizations, to be selected by the Trustees, in the exercise of sole and absolute discretion, and only-to such organization or organizations as are described in and satisfy the requirements of both of sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Code"), at the time any such payment or payments to such organization or organizations are maybe (such organization or organizations shall herein be referred to collectively as the "qualified charitable beneficiaries") in such amounts or proportions, equal or unequal, as the Trustees,'in the exercise of sole and absolute discretion, shall determine, such amount or amounts as shall, in the aggregate, equal ten percent (10\%) of the initial net fair market value of the trust assets as finally determined for federal estate tax purposes.  Such aggregate amount shall hereinafter be referred to as the ``annuity amount.''  The annuity amount shall be paid first from the ordinary taxable income of the trust (including short term capital gains) which is not unrelated business income and, to the extent not so satisfied, the annuity amount shall be paid from the long term capital gains, the unrelated business income, the tax exempt income and finally out of the principal of the trust, in that order.  In any taxable year of the trust in which the net income exceeds the annuity amount, the excess, at the end of such taxable year, shall be added to trust principal and thereafter shall be held, administered and disposed of as a part thereof.  Should the initial net fair market value of the assets comprising the trust, and hence the annuity amount, be incorrectly determined, then within a reasonable period after the value of such assets is finally determined for federal tax purposes, the Trustees shall pay over to the qualified charitable beneficiaries, in the case of an undervaluation, or, in the case of an overvaluation, shall receive from such beneficiaries to which amounts from the trust were paid, in proportion to the payments made to each, an aggregate amount equal to the difference between the annuity amount properly payable and the annuity amount actually paid during such taxable year.

JASON.  Hey.  Hey!

JULIETTE.  Just a minute.

JASON.  Ask her if it's their policy to serve paying customers.

JULIETTE.  Ask who?

JASON.  Is it your policy to serve paying customers?

JULIETTE.  You haven't paid yet.

JASON.  You haven't taken my order.

JULIETTE.  I was busy.

JASON.  But I was standing here.  What were you doing that takes precedence over a customer who's standing here waiting to pay money for said product.

JULIETTE.  ``Said product.''  What is that?

JULIETTE.  Do you have autism or something?

JULIETTE.  You should see a psychologist.

JASON.  You think I'm crazy.

JULIETTE.  You're not crazy.  You just \ldots  It's like a nervous tick or something.  Maybe a psychologist could help you out.

JASON.  A psychologist?  Do they do that sort of thing?

JULIETTE.  I don't know \ldots a psychologist \ldots a speech therapist \ldots something.  It's no big deal.  It's like stuttering.  It's just a habit your mind gets into.  You've just got to get it out of its rut.  What's that?

\emph{He hands her something.}

JULIETTE.  It's a picture of you.

JASON.  It's my headshot.

JULIETTE.  I know.  I've seen headshots before.

JASON.  No.  You can keep it.

JULIETTE.  Why?  So I can cast you in my movie?

JASON.  You have a movie?

JULIETTE.  No.

JASON.  Do you know someone that does?

JULIETTE.  Probably.

JASON.  Well then.

JULIETTE.  I mean probably someone who comes in here is making a movie.  I don't personally know casting directors or anything like that.  Hold on to that.

JASON.  Tell her she's pretty.  Doh.  Jesus.

JULIETTE.  Are you putting me on with this whole second-person thing?

JASON.  What time do you get off?

JULIETTE.  I'm married.

JASON.  You're too young to be married.

JULIETTE.  Enjoy the muffin.

JASON.  I'm sorry.  You do look young.  How old are you?

JULIETTE.  How old are you?

JASON.  We could just see a movie.  Just a friendly movie.  I'd leave one empty seat between us.

JULIETTE.  Not happening.

JASON.  You could pick the movie.

JULIETTE.  Thank you so much.

\emph{He gets his things and heads out.}

JASON.  Well, we tried.  We failed.  But at least we tried.

JULIETTE.  See ya.

\emph{He leaves.  Then he comes back.}

JASON.  Hey.  Hey!

JULIETTE.  You again.

JASON.  Have you ever seen me in here before?

JULIETTE.  Yes.  About two minutes ago.

JASON.  I mean before that.

JULIETTE.  Have we spoken before or something?  You just realized we sat next to each other in high school?  That sort of thing?  That where we're going with this?

JASON.  Damn, you're jaded.

JULIETTE.  Lay off the moves, then, you want to have a real conversation.

JASON.  Laying off the moves.

JULIETTE.  Good.

JASON.  Turning down the heat.

JULIETTE.  Okay.

JASON.  Taking the kettle off the burner.

JULIETTE.  Try not to overexert yourself.

JASON.  You're caustic, too.  Know what that means?

JULIETTE.  Innocent \ldots leads to adventurous, leads to dazzled, leads to overdone \ldots leads to bored \ldots leads to skeptical \ldots leads to deaf, leads to jaded leads to caustic.

JASON.  Are you a poet or something?

JULIETTE.  I am a poet.

JASON.  Tell me one of your poems.

JULIETTE.  No.  But thanks for noticing.

\emph{She does some work.}

JULIETTE.  How'd you know?

JASON.  Run-on sentence.

\emph{She does some more work.}

JULIETTE.  But that alone?

JASON.  That's enough.

\emph{She sits down with him.}

JULIETTE.  So this second-person tick of yours \ldots

JASON.  Yes?

JULIETTE.  That work on most girls?

JASON.  Gets the mothering instinct going.

JULIETTE.  Pity for a disability \ldots

JASON.  Hard life, life of struggle \ldots

JULIETTE.  Poor blubbering retard.

JASON.  Hey.

\emph{He sulks.  She thinks.}

JULIETTE.  Maybe try something less drastic.

JASON.  Like?

\emph{She jumps up.}

JULIETTE.  A patch over your eye \ldots I don't know!  Want another water?

JASON.  Tell me this hasn't all been a huge mistake.

JULIETTE.  Coming in here to flirt with me?

JASON.  Coming to this town \ldots paying sixty dollars for these headshots \ldots the whole thing.

JULIETTE.  Lemme see that thing again.

JASON.  What?

JULIETTE.  Your picture.

\emph{She looks it over.}

JULIETTE.  Well.

JASON.  Well what?

JULIETTE.  That's pretty good for sixty dollars.

JASON.  You can keep that one.

JULIETTE.  Nah.  Thanks, but you're better off holding onto it.  I don't really know anyone in the movies.  What do you think of Hollywood?

JASON.  You know the Greyhound station about three blocks north of here?

JULIETTE.  Yeah.

JASON.  Everything I've seen of Hollywood is on the walk between here and there.  And the inside of that headshot place.

JULIETTE.  Well don't give up yet.

JASON.  I'm so fucking stupid.

\emph{She brings him a coffee.}

JULIETTE.  On the house.

JASON.  What's your name?

JULIETTE.  Juliette.

JASON.  Thank you, Juliette.

JULIETTE.  I'm still married.

JASON.  I know.

JULIETTE.  You're welcome.

\section*{Scene 2.  The House of Pirates}

MAX.  Identify yourself.

JASON.  What?

MAX.  Make your name known to the house, good sir.

JASON.  I think I'm at the wrong place.

MAX.  No no no no no no no no no no.  No.  I seriously doubt that.  This is the place.

JASON.  Yeah?  How do you know?  You've never met me.

MAX.  I was beginning to suspect that.

JASON.  What place is this?

MAX.  No no no.  What place were you looking for.

JASON.  I don't know.

MAX.  Then how did you come to be looking for it?  Are you on some kind of scavenger hunt?

JASON.  No, I---

MAX.  Ladies, come in here \ldots I have a little amusement for you.

JASON.  I'm at the wrong house.

MAX.  Just stick around.  It'll be worth your while.

\emph{The ladies enter.}

ARIANNA.  What has the captain for our sea-weary souls?

CLOVER.  Yes, captain, who has docked our humble ship?

TRACE.  Is it foe?  Can we eat 'im?

MAX.  No, I'm afraid I already nibbled off a bit of his ear---

TRACE.  Was it good?

MAX.  No \ldots

CLOVER.  Was it edible at least?

MAX.  No \ldots

ARIANNA.  Did you taste his mouth?

MAX.  No, it was a bit sour.

ARIANNA.  We can season him.

MAX.  Any objection to that?

JASON.  What?

MAX.  Object to a little seasoning?  \ldots  Say no.

JASON.  No.

\emph{The girls rush toward Jason.}

MAX.  Hold it.

\emph{They stop.}

ARIANNA.  What?

MAX.  Go ahead.

\emph{The girls rub their bodies on Jason: seasoning.}

CLOVER.  Oooh \ldots he's so bland.

ARIANNA.  We'll fix that.

TRACE.  Get his arm.

\emph{They all rub on his arm.}

TRACE.  Get his knee.

\emph{They all rub on his knee.}

TRACE.  Get his everything!

ARIANNA.  How's it feel to be seasoned by pirates?

TRACE.  Knowing you're about to be eaten alive.

CLOVER.  Don't worry, they didn't eat the last guy.

ARIANNA.  No.  We threw him overboard.

MAX.  Tell him why you threw him overboard.

ARIANNA.  Well \ldots it was because \ldots you want to know the truth right?

\emph{Max nods.}

ARIANNA.  It was because he was too quiet.  He didn't say anything interesting.  We got bored and threw him over.

MAX.  That's your cue.

JASON.  What would you like to hear?

CLOVER.  Everything.

ARIANNA.  How did you find our ship?

TRACE.  Tell us of your adventures at sea.

JASON.  It was a dark and stormy night \ldots

ARIANNA.  What ever did you do?

TRACE.  Oooh.  I like this one.  Please continue.

JASON.  Um \ldots

MAX.  Quick with it now.

JASON.  Our ship had been attacked.

TRACE.  By who?

JASON.  By pirates.

MAX.  Which ones?  What did their flag look like?

ARIANNA.  Did it have a big green slug on it?

JASON.  Yes.

MAX.  I knew it.

ARIANNA.  The pirates of the big green slug.

CLOVER.  Our arch nemesis!

TRACE.  That slug scares me.

JASON.  It's so big.

ARIANNA.  It's so \ldots green.

CLOVER.  It's so slimy.

JASON.  Anyway we were attacked at dawn.

MAX.  What kind of vessel was yours?

JASON.  A fishing boat.  We were unarmed.

MAX.  Savages.

JASON.  They killed our most distinguished passenger.

MAX.  The captain?

JASON.  Our sushi chef.

MAX.  Damn.

ARIANNA.  Now that's uncalled for.

CLOVER.  What did you do for food?

JASON.  We had to learn to make sushi ourselves.

TRACE.  And, over time, you learned his trade?

JASON.  No.  Our sushi was terrible.

\section*{Scene 3.  The House of Pirates - Later that same night}

\emph{Max mixes something, pours it in a cup, and hands the cup to Jason.}

JASON.  What's in that?

MAX.  Just drink it.

JASON.  No, but seriously \ldots

MAX.  All you need to know \ldots

JASON.  What.

MAX.  Alcohol, right \ldots?

JASON.  Right \ldots

MAX.  Changes how you feel.  A little bit.

JASON.  Unless you drink a lot of it.

MAX.  Even if you drink a lot of it.  Drunkest you've ever been, still all it is is you move a little slower, you have a few less inhibitions, you have a little bit of trouble getting it up \ldots

JASON.  And?

MAX.  And what?

JASON.  What is that?

MAX.  It's not alcohol.  It's orange juice.

JASON.  But what's in it?

MAX.  A special mixture.

JASON.  What's that?

MAX.  A clear liquid.

JASON.  What's that?

MAX.  A white powder.

JASON.  Which powder?

MAX.  It doesn't matter.  A white powder.  Enter stage right: a white powder.

JASON.  Okay.  Exit stage left: a scared little bitch.

MAX.  Get back here.

JASON.  Are they all drinking that stuff?

MAX.  We.  We.  Yes, we're all drinking it.

JASON.  All night?

MAX.  All day.  Since three o'clock in the morning.

JASON.  Yesterday?

MAX.  If the problem is you don't like orange juice I can make you up a little package.  To swallow.  Or, rather, a series of packages.

JASON.  How can you be so sober?

MAX.  I'm not sober.

JASON.  Sober-sounding.  How many cups of that have you had?

MAX.  Six.

JASON.  Six!?

MAX.  Estimated.  I've been drinking from the blender.

JASON.  How are you still making sense then?

MAX.  How do you mean?

JASON.  After six cups of that, how can you still make sense?

MAX.  All you need to know \ldots

JASON.  What.

MAX.  Is that there are substances available on this planet---some naturally-occurring, some synthesized in the laboratory---that make the effects of six shots of vodka seem like all you took was an aspirin.  But you'll still be conscious.  You'll still be aware of what you're saying.  You'll still make sense.  \ldots  You'll still be funny.

JASON.  They haven't made a sound in like half an hour.

MAX.  When we go over there \ldots to them, it'll be like we never left.

JASON.  Just tell me what's in it.

MAX.  I'm not gonna tell you what's in it.  That's part of the fun.

JASON.  Can you \ldots

MAX.  What?

JASON.  Can you get it up on this?

MAX.  Which one do you want most?

JASON.  No, I wasn't---

MAX.  It's okay.  Just between you and me.  I promise.

JASON.  The one in the pink wig.

MAX.  Arianna.  Good choice.  Do you think she likes you back?

JASON.  I don't know.  Does she?

MAX.  I don't know either.  Drink it.

JASON.  Fuck \ldots

\emph{Jason takes a tentative sip.  Then he starts drinking.}

MAX.  And no.  You won't be able to get it up.

\emph{Jason gives Max a sideways glance.}

MAX.  But you won't care.

\section*{Scene 4.  The House of Pirates - The next morning}

ARIANNA.  Anybody---

\emph{She coughs up a lung.}

ARIANNA.  Anybody feel like a little wokenboken?

CLOVER.  Goddess, yes.

TRACE.  I would love to take a trip to Wokenboken.

JASON.  Where's Wokenboken?

ARIANNA.  You've never been to Wokenboken?

JASON.  No.  I'm from Montana.

ARIANNA.  Wokenboken is \ldots

TRACE.  It's nearby.

MAX.  It's west of Hollywood \ldots

CLOVER.  You'll like it.

MAX.  \ldots and east of Beverly Hills.

ARIANNA.  You've probably been there before and just didn't know it.

JASON.  I doubt it.  I just got here yesterday.

ARIANNA.  Really.

JASON.  Yes.  Two days before that I was in Missoula, Montana.

TRACE.  Wait.

ARIANNA.  That's wonderful \ldots

TRACE.  Wait.

ARIANNA.  How did you like the trip?

TRACE.  I just realized I have no idea who you are or how you came to be here \ldots?  Did we meet before?  Did someone introduce us?  Did I just totally wig out how I met you and all of you think I'm crazy right now?

ARIANNA.  Relax.

MAX.  He showed up at the door.

TRACE.  Oh.  So you two know each other.

MAX.  We do now.

TRACE.  But that's what I'm saying.  What was he doing before he showed up at the door?

MAX.  Ask him.

JASON.  I showed up at the wrong house.  I tried to say something last night, but \ldots

MAX.  One thing led to another.

ARIANNA.  Well.  We're glad you showed up here.

CLOVER.  Want a hit?

JASON.  Sure.

\emph{He takes a hit.}

CLOVER.  Now you've been to Wokenboken.

TRACE.  So \ldots if this was the wrong house, then what was the right one?  I mean, somewhere there's a group of people having a conversation, saying: ``Hey, where's that guy who was supposed to show up last night?''  Right?

JASON.  I don't know.  I met this girl at a coffeehouse and she told me to meet her at a party.

MAX.  Which coffeehouse?

JASON.  On Sunset.

MAX.  What was the girl's name?

JASON.  Juliette.

CLOVER.  Juliette!

TRACE.  Juliette!

ARIANNA.  Where is that Juliette?

MAX.  She was probably busy packing.

CLOVER.  She's probably in Arizona by now.

TRACE.  Arizona?

MAX.  Yeah, she and Odin decided to move to New Mexico.

ARIANNA.  You're kidding.

MAX.  No.

JASON.  Is Odin her husband?

MAX.  \ldots  Odin's her dog.

ARIANNA.  She really moved?

CLOVER.  We saw her in the coffeehouse yesterday.  She said she was moving today.

ARIANNA.  You two are joking.

MAX.  No.  Clover's right.  We saw her yesterday, she said it was her last day.

ARIANNA.  Why?

MAX.  Same spiel as always.  Tired of Hollywood bullshit.  She's gonna go \ldots live in a tent in New Mexico, I have no idea \ldots

CLOVER.  The sky is so beautiful there.

MAX.  It is beautiful there.

ARIANNA.  She really left this time?

MAX.  I think so.

ARIANNA.  I don't believe she didn't say goodbye.

CLOVER.  I'm sure she's thinking of you.  It seemed like she just needed to get away from all the chaos of the city for a while.

MAX.  Yeah, she seemed good, she wasn't mad or anything.  She just needed to get the heck out.

ARIANNA.  New Mexico is beautiful.  I hope it's better for her.

CLOVER.  I have her email address.

\emph{Clover hugs Arianna.}

TRACE.  So, wait a minute.  You just met Juliette yesterday, and you were in \ldots Montana \ldots two days before.  Where are you staying?

JASON.  I don't know yet.

TRACE.  Do you know anyone here?

JASON.  Everyone I know here is in this room.

CLOVER.  Well, we might be able to \ldots there's an extra room---

ARIANNA.  Trace was thinking about moving into that, though, if her place doesn't work out \ldots  Weren't you \ldots?

TRACE.  Yeah.  Well.

ARIANNA.  But we could talk it over, and see---

JASON.  That's nice of you, but---

ARIANNA.  At the very least I bet we know someone who's looking for a roommate.

\section*{Scene 5.  The House of Pirates - A different day}

\emph{Clover is there strumming a guitar.  Jason comes in.}

CLOVER.  How was your day?

JASON.  Long.  \ldots  How was your day?

CLOVER.  Good.  I've been meditating and doing yoga.  Also, I spent some time in the kitchen, just cleansing the space.  It feels much better in there now.

JASON.  Where's Arianna?

CLOVER.  She's out---I think she went out to look for jobs.

JASON.  Really.  What's she looking for?

CLOVER.  I think she's just looking for anything she can find, you know, until something better comes up.

JASON.  Does ``anything she can find'' mean just acting jobs, or does it mean all jobs, as in: I could use some help with the rent here.

CLOVER.  I'm gonna give you some time to yourself so you can unwind.

\emph{Clover leaves.  Jason cracks a beer.  Arianna comes in.}

ARIANNA.  Oh hello.

JASON.  Where have you been?

ARIANNA.  Is that a beer?  \ldots  You know I don't like drinking in this room.  It's a very dark energy.  Perhaps you'd be kind enough to sit on the porch, if you're going to make this part of your daily ritual.

\emph{Jason fumes silently.}

ARIANNA.  Are you upset about something?

JASON.  Guess.

ARIANNA.  I'm not in the mood to play mind-reader.  If you have something to say I'd appreciate if you'd just say it.

JASON.  Did Clover do anything today that had to do with looking for a job?  Did she even leave the house?

ARIANNA.  Oh, so that's what this is about.

JASON.  Did she?

ARIANNA.  I don't know.  Is she here now?

JASON.  She's in her room.  What's in the bag?

ARIANNA.  Something.

JASON.  Something you bought?

ARIANNA.  Don't touch that!  It's a surprise.

JASON.  You shouldn't have.

ARIANNA.  It's not for you.

JASON.  I know.  You bought yourself a surprise un-birthday present from Godiva.  Do you know what I had for dinner tonight?    A Big Mac.  Know why?  Cause it costs two dollars.  We have a cashflow problem here that's going to result in us being unable to pay our rent and I'm the only one who's willing to work for a living and not spend every extra penny I have on Godiva fucking organic tofu and bottled water when there's free water right here coming out of the faucet.  Do you know what Clover bought today?  A new guitar.  A new guitar.  She already has two guitars.  I play the guitar, does anyone here know that?  You know how many guitars I have?  None.  Know why?  Cause they're expensive.  Clover, how much did that guitar cost you?

\emph{Clover has come in while he was talking.}

CLOVER.  I'm buying it on a payment plan.

JASON.  But how many payment plans are you doing right now?  That's my point.  The three of us can't afford any more payment plans.  We have to pay rent in four days.

CLOVER.  Jason, I don't like how you get when you're drinking.

JASON.  I have had half a beer!

ARIANNA.  I asked him not to drink in here.

JASON.  But I'm gonna drink in here anyway.  Know why?  How much rent did you contribute last month?  How much did you contribute?  That's why.  I'm working Labor Ready six days a week to pay for this place.  If I want to have a beer in the house, then I'll have a beer in the house.  The second either of you decides to seriously look for a job then such matters can be decided by family conference, but until then \ldots

CLOVER.  It's really hard to find a job when you feel so much pressure.  I know Arianna's been trying to find one and I've been trying too and---

JASON.  When?

CLOVER.  What?

JASON.  When have you been trying?

CLOVER.  All the time.

JASON.  Did you try today?

CLOVER.  You may be capable of spending every moment of every day trying to find a job but I'm sensitive.  I can't just go out into the world all the time and sell myself to people I hardly know---

JASON.  Well that's what the world is.

ARIANNA.  I wish you wouldn't take such a \ldots kindof \ldots superior attitude when we're talking about this.  It makes it really hard to have a conversation with you.

JASON.  You know what you could do, if finding a job is too hard on your sensitivities?

ARIANNA.  What?

JASON.  Don't buy Godiva.  Don't buy any more guitars.

ARIANNA.  You can have a piece.

JASON.  I don't want a piece.  I want you to help me pay this month's rent.  I want you to pay me what you owe me for last month's rent.

\emph{Jason leaves.}

CLOVER.  What's wrong with him?

ARIANNA.  I think he's just tense cause he hasn't gotten laid in a while.

\section*{Scene 6.  The House of Pirates: Jason's room - Some night}

ARIANNA.  Do you mind that I don't shave my legs?

JASON.  No.

ARIANNA.  Cause it seems to bother some guys.

JASON.  It's your body.

ARIANNA.  Exactly.  Why should I have to shave my legs or---uagghh---my armpits.  Just to impress some guy?  Just cause they think it's sexy?  Do you think it's sexy?

JASON.  What?

ARIANNA.  When a girl shaves her armpits?

JASON.  Well---

ARIANNA.  It hurts.  It hurts growing back.  All those little stubbly hairs.

JASON.  I guess that's why some girls keep shaving them.

ARIANNA.  But why should we have to shave them in the first place?  Guys don't have to shave their armpits.

JASON.  We have to shave our face.

ARIANNA.  You don't have to shave it.  You could choose not to and no one would look down on you.  I was walking down Santa Monica the other day and do you know what some guy did?  He pulled over to the side of the street---stopped his car---to ask me why I didn't shave my armpits.  Can you believe that?

JASON.  That's messed up.

ARIANNA.  You don't shave your armpits.  I bet no one ever stopped their car to talk to you about it.

JASON.  If a guy wants to get a certain kind of job, he has to shave his face.

ARIANNA.  No they don't.

JASON.  Sure they do.

ARIANNA.  Like what?

JASON.  Any kind of office job.

ARIANNA.  People in offices have beards.

JASON.  But it changes how you're looked at.

ARIANNA.  When did you ever work in an office.

JASON.  I worked collections.  In Florida.  You show up for a job interview with a beard and see where that gets you.  They think ``hippie.''  They think ``scraggly.''  And even if you get the job you won't get promoted.  All the hot shots, places like that \ldots no beard.

ARIANNA.  That's different.

JASON.  No it's not.  How many U.S.  presidents can you think of who had a beard?

ARIANNA.  Abraham Lincoln.

JASON.  But recently.

ARIANNA.  Maybe, I don't know \ldots

JASON.  Governors.  Senators.  Those guys aren't allowed to have beards.

ARIANNA.  But if they did, no one would yell ``sasquatch!''

JASON.  But people wouldn't trust them, though.

ARIANNA.  Maybe \ldots

JASON.  Did that guy really say ``sasquatch''?

ARIANNA.  Maybe Lincoln didn't have a beard \ldots

JASON.  Who can say?  He probably had one at some point.

ARIANNA.  So you don't mind?

JASON.  What?

ARIANNA.  That I don't shave my legs.

JASON.  Why would I mind?

ARIANNA.  Have you ever had a girlfriend who didn't shave hers?

JASON.  It's been a while since I had a girlfriend.

ARIANNA.  Why is that?

JASON.  What do you mean?

ARIANNA.  Are you fasting?

JASON.  No.

ARIANNA.  Did you have a bad experience with the last one?

JASON.  Yes.  \ldots  Her armpit hair was out of control.

ARIANNA.  Seriously.  Don't you miss it?

JASON.  How long since you had a boyfriend?

ARIANNA.  I can't think of the last time I had a boyfriend \ldots but \ldots since I was with someone \ldots?  Maybe two months.

JASON.  I haven't been with anyone in three years.

ARIANNA.  You're kidding.

JASON.  No.

ARIANNA.  Why?

JASON.  Just \ldots because.  Let's leave it at that.

\emph{She kisses him lightly.}

ARIANNA.  Do you want to touch my legs?

\emph{They start to make out.}

ARIANNA.  Do you mind if the rest of me isn't shaven?

\emph{They make out more.  She grabs his hand.}

ARIANNA.  No.  I don't want you to touch it.

JASON.  Why did you mention it then?

ARIANNA.  I might---  Just not now.  Maybe later.

JASON.  As in ``later tonight'' or as in ``some other day that will never happen''?

ARIANNA.  Maybe \ldots later tonight.

JASON.  You know that's about the fourth time you've said that to me?

ARIANNA.  Sometimes you're too pushy.

JASON.  Why do you play this game?

ARIANNA.  Game?

JASON.  You walk around in your underwear.  I'm lying here reading.  You're fixing yourself a midnight snack and it takes you twelve trips to get everything you need from the refrigerator.

ARIANNA.  It wasn't twelve trips.

JASON.  Whatever.  You know what I mean.

ARIANNA.  I'm in my underwear because it's hot.  Look what you're wearing.

JASON.  This is my room.  I'm not prancing around in front of your doorway.

ARIANNA.  My doorway isn't on the way to the kitchen.

JASON.  But twelve times?

ARIANNA.  It wasn't twelve.

JASON.  Okay.  Six.

ARIANNA.  It wasn't six.

JASON.  I counted.

\emph{Arianna leaves.  She comes back.}

ARIANNA.  Six round trips \ldots or six times crossing the doorway?

JASON.  Six times crossing the doorway.

ARIANNA.  So that's really only three trips.

JASON.  The point is \ldots why are you in your underwear.

ARIANNA.  It's hot.

JASON.  Right \ldots

ARIANNA.  This is what I sleep in.

JASON.  Are you sleeping now?

ARIANNA.  If you don't want me to visit anymore---

JASON.  ``Do you want to touch my legs?''

ARIANNA.  \ldots  No.

JASON.  That's what you said to me.  Five minutes ago.  That's a friendly visit?

ARIANNA.  I just want---

JASON.  You want to tease me.

ARIANNA.  No, I---

JASON.  But always turn me down.

ARIANNA.  I just don't want to go all the way.

\emph{She kisses him again.}

JASON.  Why in the hell did you do that?

ARIANNA.  It was just \ldots impulse.

JASON.  Please just let me jerk off and sleep.

ARIANNA.  So crude.

JASON.  Hey.  That's how it is.

ARIANNA.  I think I'll have my snack now.

JASON.  Enjoy.

ARIANNA.  Want me to come back afterward?

JASON.  For another cocktease?

ARIANNA.  I was going to give you a massage \ldots

JASON.  ``Five dollar happy ending?''

ARIANNA.  You know what?  Fuck off.

\section*{Scene 7.  The House of Velvet}

JASON.  I want to ask you something.

MAX.  Yep.

JASON.  But I don't want this to get back to the girls.

MAX.  It stays here.

JASON.  That girl, Trace, from the party the night I first met you \ldots

MAX.  Is she single?

\emph{Jason nods.}

MAX.  Yes.  Do you want to meet her?

JASON.  Do you have her number?

MAX.  We used to live together.

JASON.  Together together?

\emph{Max nods.}

JASON.  So do you mind if I call her?

MAX.  Not at all.  I think she may like you as well.

JASON.  Really?

MAX.  Maybe.

JASON.  Did she say something?

MAX.  She asked about you after the party.

JASON.  Why didn't you tell me?

MAX.  She asked me not to.

JASON.  Why?

MAX.  I don't know.  That's just what she said.

JASON.  Did it seem like she didn't want me to know because she liked me?

MAX.  I don't know.  She just asked about you.  She didn't say, ``Is he single, could you hook me up on a date,'' she just asked what I knew about you, what I thought of you.

JASON.  You said good things I hope \ldots

MAX.  Actually, yes, I did.

JASON.  How long did you two used to live together?

MAX.  About a year.

JASON.  A year!  How long ago was this?

MAX.  This \ldots is a while back.

JASON.  But you two are friends now?

MAX.  Yeah.  She's one of my best friends.

JASON.  Who broke up with who?

MAX.  I broke up with her.

JASON.  Do you think she still likes you?

MAX.  Well \ldots

JASON.  Cause I was getting that sort of vibe from her at the party.

MAX.  Yeah.  She probably does.

JASON.  Are you still into her?

MAX.  I like her as a friend.

JASON.  That's it though?

MAX.  That's it.  You want to meet her sometime?

JASON.  Would that be cool?

MAX.  Sure.  When?

JASON.  I don't know \ldots this weekend?

MAX.  Ok.  I'll call her.

JASON.  What are you gonna say?

MAX.  Don't worry, I'm not gonna say, ``Hey Trace, Jason really likes you.  You want to come over, maybe make out with him or something?''

JASON.  What are you gonna say, though?

MAX.  I'll think of something.

JASON.  Don't make her suspicious.

MAX.  She's not gonna be suspicious.

JASON.  I'm just saying.

MAX.  I lived with her for a year.  We're best friends.  If I invite her over to my place she's not gonna be suspicious.

JASON.  Are you gonna say I'm gonna be here?

MAX.  Maybe.

JASON.  You think that's a good idea?

MAX.  I don't think it matters.  She'll come over.  You two'll get a chance to interact.  If it's gonna happen \ldots it'll happen.

JASON.  She might still like you, though \ldots you said that.

MAX.  Yeah.  She might.  She probably does.  But she and I are over.

JASON.  Maybe from your point of view.  But if she's still stuck on you, how's she gonna go for me?

MAX.  Maybe she doesn't want to be stuck on me---if, in fact she is.  Maybe she's looking for a reason to forget about me.

JASON.  But you two are still friends.

MAX.  Yeah, but I mean: maybe she needs a reason to forget about the possibility that we might get back together.

JASON.  And you think she likes me.

MAX.  She might.

JASON.  And you wouldn't mind \ldots?

MAX.  Not at all.  You're a good man.  She'd be lucky.

\emph{They're silent for a moment.}

MAX.  There's just one thing.

JASON.  What?

MAX.  Well \ldots

JASON.  There's a well.

MAX.  Well \ldots

JASON.  What?

MAX.  It's not a big well.

JASON.  What is it?

MAX.  Well---

JASON.  Stop with that.

MAX.  Okay.  Sometimes--

JASON.  I knew it.

MAX.  What?  What did you know?

JASON.  There's a sometimes.

MAX.  It's not a bad sometimes.  It's just a sometimes.

JASON.  And \ldots

MAX.  Sometimes \ldots Trace?  \ldots she and me \ldots we still \ldots

JASON.  You mean \ldots you two \ldots?

MAX.  Yes.

JASON.  No \ldots how long has it been since you guys broke up?

MAX.  Over a year.

JASON.  How much over?

MAX.  Just about one year.

JASON.  And you still \ldots?

MAX.  Yeah.

JASON.  Jesus.  \ldots  When was the last time you \ldots?

\emph{Max stalls.}

MAX.  About a week ago.

JASON.  I thought you said it was over.

MAX.  It is.

JASON.  But you fucked her last week?

MAX.  Emotionally.  Psychologically.  It's over.  It was over before she moved out.  It's just hard \ldots to stop \ldots you know.

JASON.  So \ldots what \ldots you were going to invite her over and then \ldots the three of us?

MAX.  No, no.  We're trying to stop.  We both want to stop.  It's just when you've been with someone for so long \ldots

JASON.  So if she comes over \ldots how's that gonna work if the two of you are still together?

MAX.  We're not together---

JASON.  But you still---

MAX.  Yes, but it's over.  Emotionally.  We're just friends.  She's not with anyone and I'm not with anyone, so it's just \ldots convenient.

JASON.  You're the luckiest guy I know.

MAX.  It puts a strain on the friendship.

JASON.  That's every man's dream.

MAX.  It's really not a good thing.

JASON.  So when she comes over \ldots what's gonna happen?

MAX.  Nothing.  We'll just hang out.

JASON.  Won't that be awkward?

MAX.  No.

JASON.  But how's she gonna like me if you two are still \ldots

MAX.  We're gonna stop.

JASON.  Sure.

MAX.  No, we are.

JASON.  Uh-huh.

MAX.  I really need to \ldots for my own sake.  It's been dragging on too long.

JASON.  Well let me be your excuse.

MAX.  Deal.

\emph{They cement the deal physically: shoulder-pats, handshake, whatever.}

JASON.  You won't mind if I fuck her?

MAX.  If she doesn't mind it's fine with me.

JASON.  You are a god damn gigolo.

MAX.  Does it bother you that I just fucked her yesterday?

JASON.  You said last week.

MAX.  I'm just fucking with you.

JASON.  Nah, man, we're friends \ldots it doesn't bother me.

\emph{Beat.}

JASON.  You're really gonna stop though?

MAX.  Yes.

\emph{Beat.}

JASON.  You really think she likes me?

MAX.  Maybe.

\section*{Scene 8.  The House of Velvet - Some night}

CLOVER.  Oh, god, put me in a blender.

\emph{Everyone cracks up.}

CLOVER.  I mean, oh, god, put this back in the blender.  It's too gritty.

MAX.  Can someone take that off her hands?

TRACE.  Yes.

MAX.  Thank you.  Okay.  Clover.  While we're blending your concoction---

CLOVER.  Re-blending.

MAX.  What?

CLOVER.  Re-blending.

MAX.  While we're re-blending your concoction.  Could you put your hand \ldots put your arm around Arianna.  Around her neck, and---

ARIANNA.  Do you want us to kiss?

MAX.  If you want to.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's cool.

ARIANNA.  Why don't you lie back a little.

TRACE.  Oh, that's hot.

MAX.  Yeah.  Cool.  That's nice.  You guys want to stop for a while?

TRACE.  No!  Keep going.  I'm in \ldots me!  me!

MAX.  Kiss her.

TRACE.  Oh that turns me on.

MAX.  You kiss her too.

TRACE.  No really, stop, you're turning me on.  Ahhh!

CLOVER.  Don't you like to be turned on?

ARIANNA.  Oww!  Watch the leg.

MAX.  This is bizarre-looking.

ARIANNA.  What!  Don't you think I'm sexy?

MAX.  Not right now.

ARIANNA.  I'm taking a break.  When you're ready to be turned on, let me know.

TRACE.  Is she mad?

MAX.  No.

TRACE.  Are you mad?

ARIANNA.  No, darling.  Just taking a break.

MAX.  Ok, Jason, get in there.

TRACE.  Is she sure she's not mad?

CLOVER AND MAX.  She's not.

MAX.  Maybe put your \ldots I don't know, just sit on her.

TRACE.  On me?

MAX.  Or \ldots maybe \ldots sit with her \ldots I don't know \ldots just \ldots sit \ldots close to her.

TRACE.  Maybe he should take his shirt off.

MAX.  Yeah, maybe.  Sure.  Could you bring me that light?

ARIANNA.  Where do you want it.

MAX.  Just \ldots on them.

TRACE.  I'm thirsty.

CLOVER.  Where's my shake?

MAX.  Here.

CLOVER.  Did someone blend it?

TRACE.  You mean re-blend it.

MAX.  No.

CLOVER.  I can't drink it like this.

TRACE.  I'll re-blend it for you.

MAX.  But we're taking a picture.

TRACE.  Later.

MAX.  We'll re-blend it for you in a second.  Maybe you could \ldots put your arms around him.  That's good.

JASON.  What do you want me to do?

MAX.  Just look pretty.  Trace, maybe you could wrap your arms around his head.

TRACE.  Like a snake?

MAX.  Exactly.  Like a snake.

TRACE.  Mmmmmm \ldots

MAX.  That's good.  Don't smile.

TRACE.  Like a constrictor \ldots

ARIANNA.  Let him breathe some, though.

MAX.  No don't let him breathe.

TRACE.  I won't.  Cause I'm hungry.

MAX.  That's good.  That's a good picture.  Alright, I'm gonna go re-blend this shake.

TRACE.  Do I get to swallow him now?

MAX.  Just save some of him so we can take pictures of it later.

Trace gets forward and close with Jason.

TRACE.  Is this too much for you?

JASON.  You're fine.

\emph{They start to make out.}

\section*{Scene 9.  The House of Velvet - Later that night}

\emph{Arianna is standing, oblivious.  Max is looking at her.  Jason comes up.}

JASON.  Jesus.  All she'll do to me is tease me with her panties, you've got her modeling for you, kissing girls on command \ldots

MAX.  That's not all she does on command.

\emph{Max goes to Arianna and moves her with his hands.  She starts dancing, sexy, slow.}

JASON.  Holy shit.  Can she hear us?

MAX.  Not anymore.

JASON.  What is this?

MAX.  Private show.

JASON.  How did you get her like that?

MAX.  Ask her.

\emph{Jason goes to her.  Arianna's movement stuns him, draws him in.}

JASON.  You're like water.

ARIANNA.  It's probably the morphine.

\emph{Jason goes back to Max.}

JASON.  Have you fucked her?

MAX.  What do you think?

JASON.  Jesus.  \ldots  How recently.

MAX.  What do you care?  Weren't you and Trace just making out on my couch?  Get back to that.

\section*{Scene 10.  The House of Velvet - The next morning}

MAX.  So what happened?

ARIANNA.  She left, that's what happened.

MAX.  Please.  I'm not talking to you.

JASON.  She just didn't want to.

MAX.  Was she mad?

JASON.  What do you think I did to her?

MAX.  I don't think you did anything to her.  That's not what's going on here.  I just want to know if she was mad, that's all.

JASON.  Why?

MAX.  Was she upset?

JASON.  Nothing happened.

MAX.  That's cool.  I don't want to get in your business.  It's just \ldots she's not answering her phone, she had some \ldots medicine \ldots while she was here \ldots and I just want to know if she's mad \ldots maybe that's why she's not answering her phone \ldots?

JASON.  Can she leave?

ARIANNA.  No, I want to hear this.

MAX.  Please.

\emph{Arianna leaves.}

MAX.  What happened?

JASON.  Nothing happened.

MAX.  Nothing?

JASON.  We kissed.

MAX.  That's it?

JASON.  Why do you want to know?

MAX.  Dude.  Chill.  This isn't an interrogation.  It's just you and me.  I'm not saying you raped her.  I don't think that, okay?  I'm curious, as your friend, how it went.  Also I want to know if she was mad when she left because she's not answering her phone.  Everybody around here's a little paranoid this morning, myself included.  I'm not attacking you.

JASON.  Nothing happened.

MAX.  Well I'm sorry to hear that.

JASON.  Me too.

MAX.  Was she mean to you?

JASON.  All your ex-girlfriends just lead me on.

MAX.  She led you on?

JASON.  She got me this close.

MAX.  And then?

JASON.  And then nothing.

MAX.  With her mouth?

JASON.  That's all she would do.

MAX.  She gives great head, though, doesn't she?

JASON.  The best.

MAX.  Did you try to go down on her?

JASON.  Was that a mistake?

MAX.  She probably thought you were rushing it.

JASON.  Really?  Cause I just wanted to be fair \ldots

MAX.  No, that's how she is.

JASON.  She doesn't want me to go down---?

MAX.  For her that's more intimate.  Not right away.

JASON.  So she's not mad at me?

MAX.  She sucked your dick?

JASON.  Yes.

MAX.  No!

\emph{Beat.}

JASON.  Why didn't she let me \ldots?

MAX.  Probably because you tried to \ldots?

JASON.  But I just wanted her to \ldots?

MAX.  She likes it when you \ldots first.  It's a pride thing.

JASON.  Oh.  \ldots  I've got the worst case of blue balls.

MAX.  Bathroom.  Arianna!  Let's get coffee!

\emph{Arianna comes in.}

ARIANNA.  So you men are done with your private conversation?

MAX.  What's in your hand?

ARIANNA.  Phone.

MAX.  Trace?

ARIANNA.  Set to vibrate.

MAX.  No wonder.  Where's Clove?

ARIANNA.  She's fuckin \ldots passed out somewhere.

MAX.  We'll bring you something.

\section*{Scene 11.  The House of Velvet: The bathroom - Just a few seconds later}

\emph{Jason goes in the bathroom.  Clover is lying on the floor in a blanket.}

JASON.  Oh.

CLOVER.  It's okay.  Don't leave.

JASON.  I'll just be a second.  What are you doing in here?

CLOVER.  Sleeping.  It's warm in here.  And I like the sound of the water.

\emph{Jason closes up shop and turns around.}

CLOVER.  Whatsa matter?

JASON.  I can't pee with you here.

CLOVER.  I'll leave.

JASON.  No.  You look so comfortable.

CLOVER.  Feel this blanket.

JASON.  Crazy party.

CLOVER.  We used to do this every Friday.

JASON.  Here?

CLOVER.  Here, and at our place.

JASON.  Really.

CLOVER.  This isn't even a party.

JASON.  No?

CLOVER.  Uh-uh.  It's just a gettogether.  I'll leave if you have to pee.

JASON.  No, stay.  I'll try again in a minute.

\emph{They sit for a second.}

JASON.  So \ldots I mean \ldots have you and Max \ldots?

CLOVER.  Yes.  Once.  It was an accident.

JASON.  I shouldn't have asked that.

CLOVER.  I don't care.  Everyone knows.  \ldots  It wasn't just the two of us, by the way.

JASON.  So everybody here's had sex with everybody else?

CLOVER.  Well, what do you expect?  We've all known each other for a very long time.

JASON.  Jhesus.

\emph{He gets up and goes to the toilet.}

CLOVER.  Can you pee now?

JASON.  I don't think so.

CLOVER.  Did that excite you \ldots to hear about?

JASON.  Are you looking?

CLOVER.  Sorry.  I didn't see anything.

JASON.  It's okay.  Everyone here's seen everyone else, I guess.  I came in here to pee.  I didn't mind if you saw my \ldots  But I didn't expect you to see it \ldots

CLOVER.  Big?

JASON.  Yeah.

CLOVER.  Is it going away?

JASON.  No.

\emph{Clover stands up and lets the blanket fall away.}

CLOVER.  Do you want some help?

\section*{Scene 12.  A New House}

\emph{Jason is holding a baby in a blanket, singing softly.}

JASON.  Nora Nora Nora.  Nora Nora Nora.

Clover tries to hand him something.

CLOVER.  Jase.

JASON.  Put that shit away.  At least go in the other room.

CLOVER.  Okay \ldots you don't have to yell.

JASON.  Shhh \ldots she's almost asleep.

CLOVER.  Why do you have to be so judgmental?

JASON.  Just go in the other room.

\emph{She goes.}

JASON.  You want to go to sleep now, dontcha little baby.  You're ready.  You're ready to dream.  Ready to dream.  Good baby.

\emph{A knock at the door.}

JASON.  Christ.

\emph{He opens it.}

MAX.  Hey man.

JASON.  Come in \ldots just \ldots keep it quiet, okay?  I've almost got her down.

MAX.  No problem.  Hey.

JASON.  What.

MAX.  I've got Trace and Arianna with me, do you mind?

JASON.  No.  Just \ldots keep it quiet.  \ldots  Clover.  Clove.  Take her, willya?  She's asleep.

CLOVER.  Who's out there?

JASON.  Everybody.

\emph{Clover takes her.}

JASON.  That kid is a bitch to get down.

ARIANNA.  We're going down Hollywood, wanna come?

JASON.  Why?

MAX.  Cause of the Virgin Mary Grilled Cheese Sandwich.

JASON.  The what?

TRACE.  That's not why.

MAX.  They've got this grilled cheese sandwich shaped like The Virgin Mary.

TRACE.  It's not shaped like her.  It's her face.

MAX.  You gotta see it dude, come with us.

JASON.  I can't.

\emph{Clover comes back without the baby.}

CLOVER.  Greetings my celestial friends.  What fabulous journeys bring you to our lovely home?

MAX.  Religious conversion.

ARIANNA.  House party!

TRACE.  You know Max's friend \ldots the director \ldots what't his name?

MAX.  He's not my friend.

TRACE.  He's throwing a party.

ARIANNA.  It's gonna be the wildest thing you've ever seen.

TRACE.  We went to this party of his two years ago.  It was \ldots unbelievable.

MAX.  It was ridiculous.  You gotta come.

JASON.  We can't.

CLOVER.  But Jase---

JASON.  Who's gonna watch Nora?

ARIANNA.  Bring her along.

JASON.  No.

CLOVER.  Why not?

JASON.  You can't bring a three-month-old to a ``ridiculous'' party.

ARIANNA.  He's exaggerating.  It wasn't ridiculous.

JASON.  The answer's no.

ARIANNA.  I'm sure she'll be fine in one of the side rooms.

CLOVER.  She'll be fine.  I'll spend most of my time in the room with her.

JASON.  But you won't, that's the problem.

CLOVER.  Why do I have to be the one to watch her all the time?

JASON.  I'm not suggesting you watch her.  I'm suggesting we stay here.

MAX.  Bring her, Jason, it's not gonna be that bad.

JASON.  There's gonna be \ldots stuff \ldots there?

MAX.  There's \ldots stuff \ldots all over your coffeetable.

JASON.  Forget it.

ARIANNA.  Clovey, you come then.

\emph{Clover looks to Jason for approval.}

JASON.  What?

CLOVER.  Is that okay?

JASON.  Sure.  Go.

CLOVER.  Are you gonna be mad?

JASON.  No.

CLOVER.  Are you lying?

JASON.  Guess.

CLOVER.  I need to get out of the house.  We've been cooped up in here with her every day.  I'll go for a while and come back \ldots then you can go.

ARIANNA.  Cmon \ldots it's just a party \ldots it'll be good for you two.

JASON.  How long will you be?

ARIANNA.  Two hours?

JASON.  You'll be back in two hours.

CLOVER.  Then you can go.

JASON.  I'm not going.

CLOVER.  Don't be like that.  Why not?

MAX.  There's gonna be a lot of people there.

TRACE.  There's gonna be a casting agent there.

\emph{Jason looks to Max for confirmation.}

MAX.  Yeah.

JASON.  For who?

MAX.  Some indie company.  Maybe it's nothing, but \ldots maybe it's something.

JASON.  \ldots  Forget it.

MAX.  Your choice bro.

JASON.  You guys just go.

\emph{They gather, head for the door.  Clover comes back.}

CLOVER.  You're not gonna be mad at me?

JASON.  Clover, I'm already mad at you.

ARIANNA.  Just bring her with us \ldots she'll be fine in a side room I promise.

MAX.  We gotta go.  Clove?

\emph{Clover goes to the door with them.}

MAX.  Want us to bring you something back?

JASON.  No.

\emph{They leave.  Jason is still for a moment.  Then he kicks over the coffeetable.}

JASON.  Fuck!

JEFF, a thirty-five year old man, Adele's uncle, comes hiking out of the forest.  He's dressed in deep-woods gear.  His hair and clothing suggest he lives rustically.  Adele sees him first.  She looks like him like she sort-of recognizes him, but isn't sure it's him.  She tugs at her mother's arm.  Carol looks up.  She discreetly puts her top on and gets up.  Adele follows behind her mother.  Carol hugs Jeff warmly.}

GRANT.  Staying gone for a very long time?

\emph{Jeff clinks Grant's beer with his own.}

JEFF.  Sure bro.

\emph{Adele prances in the grass, showing her bathing-suited bottom off to the new arrival.  Carol turns to her husband and brother as much as she can given that she's topless.}

CAROL.  At this age, girls are starving for attention.

ADELE.  What was that?

CAROL.  Nothing.

ADELE.  I didn't think so.

\emph{Adele takes takes an apple that was sitting on her chair.  She walks off, spunkily waving her butt for Jeff to see.  She's carrying a towel and wearing flip-flops as she starts down a path leading into the woods.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - DAY}

\emph{In her swimsuit and wrapped in a towel, Adele sits high in a tree eating an apple.  When she finishes she tosses the core and climbs down expertly, stepping into her flip-flops.}

\section*{EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY}

\emph{Adele comes through the woods toward the log cabin.  Through the obstruction of trees, she sees the form of her mother, sunbathing, and a man leaning over her applying lotion.  Carol is topless, lying face-down with her arms stretched out in front of her.  As Adele comes to the edge of the clearing where the cabin is, she sees that the man is Jeff.  She walks toward them.  Jeff sees her first.  He continues rubbing Carol's naked back while his eyes lock Adele's.  When Adele is closer, Carol sees her, looks up.  Carol doesn't change her position, but she is clearly a little embarrased.  She tries to play it off.}

CAROL.  How was your walk?

ADELE.  \emph{(sarcastically)} Oh it was beautiful \ldots just beautiful.

\emph{She goes past them into the cabin.}

\section*{INT. LOG CABIN - DAY}

\emph{Grant is cleaning one of the hunting rifles at the table covered with a red-and-white checkered picnic tablecloth.  Adele plops down next to him.}

ADELE.  Where's Mom?

GRANT.  Isn't she outside with Jeff?

ADELE.  And what do you think they're doing?

GRANT.  How would I know that?

\emph{Adele takes his hand.}

ADELE.  Come outside.  I'll show you.

GRANT.  I'm busy here!

ADELE.  She's naked!  He's got his hands all over her!

\emph{This gets Grant's attention.}

GRANT.  Oh yeah?

ADELE.  Yeah.

GRANT.  Let's go see.

\emph{Grant gets up, still holding the gun.}

\section*{EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY}

\emph{Grant and Adele come outside.  Carol has her top on, and she's tying the strap.  Jeff has moved to the other chair.}

GRANT.  What do y'all have going on out here?

CAROL.  Pardon?

ADELE.  She had her top off!  She was lying there and he was rubbing all over her!

\emph{No response from Grant.  He looks from Carol to Adele.}

ADELE.  I'm telling you the truth.  You saw her trying her top!  You're gonna pretend this isn't---

\emph{Grant hits Adele in the face.  It knocks her down and she bleeds because of it.  Carol stands in sympathy for her daughter, but she's afraid of Grant, and won't move farther.}

ADELE.  Why did---?

CAROL.  Baby---

GRANT.  You have a dirty mind.

ADELE.  But she---

GRANT.  Don't talk that way about your mother.

ADELE.  But---

\emph{Grant raises his hand.  That shuts her up.}

GRANT.  Just don't.

\emph{He goes back inside the house.  Jeff stands and turns his back on the situation, wandering toward the woods in denial.  Carol goes to her daughter, but slowly, and not to help her.  The mother towers over her girl.}

CAROL.  What did you tell him?

\section*{EXT. WOODS - DAY}

\emph{Fully dressed, Adele climbs up the tree she was sitting in before, this time to a precarious height.  She straddles a limb and takes a zip-lock bag from her pocket.  The bag contains several granola bars.  Adele uses her knife to cut a length of fishing line, and she secures the bag to a small branch.  Shakily, she stands up.  Holding onto an overhead branch, she steps away from the trunk of the tree.  Gingerly, she lets her hands release the overhead branch, and she balances.}

\section*{EXT. CABIN - DAY}

\emph{Carol comes out of the cabin and goes to the edge of the woods.  She yells:}

CAROL.  Adele!  Adele!  Honey, if you can hear me, come on back.

\emph{Grant comes outside.}

CAROL.  How far do you think she went?

GRANT.  \emph{(yelling:)} Adele!  Come back, alright, you're scaring your mother.  \emph{(to Carol:)} She didn't go far.  She can't be that far.  \emph{(yelling:)} Adele!  Time to eat!

CAROL.  \emph{(yelling:)} Adele!  Baby we're not waiting forever.  \emph{(to Grant:)} She knows how to keep a grudge, don't she?  \emph{(yelling:)} Adele!  'dele!

\emph{Carol shakes her head.}

CAROL.  Well \ldots

\emph{Grant shrugs.}

CAROL.  I ain't waiting.

\emph{They go into the house together.}

\section*{INT. CABIN - DAY}

\emph{Grant, Carol, and Jeff sit around eating dinner.  Carol drinks a beer.  Grant and Jeff both drink whisky.}

GRANT.  Her grades is fine.  It's not her grades we gotta handle.

CAROL.  There's just some things you can't let 'em het away with.  But I can't stop her.  Hell, I can't even keep track of her.

GRANT.  She's sneaky.

CAROL.  She is sneaky.

JEFF.  What she need is discipline.

CAROL.  You don't think we discipline the girl?  Now, come on, who do you think you're talking to, here?  She don't care.  What do you think I haven't taken away?  I've taken away everything.  She don't care.  I walk out the house she's taking a taxi to school so she don't have to ride in a car with me.

GRANT.  I walk out the house she's got her little boyfriend on the swing with her, and I mean \ldots

JEFF.  Was they whooping it up?

CAROL.  She wasn't whooping it up \ldots

GRANT.  Not quite.  Not quite.  But there's a way to do things and there's a way not to, and that girl \ldots

JEFF.  Oh man \ldots

CAROL.  You don't know the half of it.

GRANT.  Am I right?  I mean there's things to wear and there's things not to.

JEFF.  Oh boy \ldots

CAROL.  She sneaks out with that stuff on.  Lord.  I can't stop her.

GRANT.  No one can stop her.

\emph{Jeff is chuckling.}

CAROL.  Lord.

GRANT.  I can't.

CAROL.  \emph{(a prayer)} Help me with that girl.

\emph{Adele clears her throat:}

ADELE.  Ah-hem \ldots?

\emph{She's been standing at the door.  There is an uncomfortable silence.  Then Jeff busts out laughing, in a drunk way.}

JEFF.  She is sneaky, damn \ldots!

\emph{Adele sits at the table.}

ADELE.  Y'all got nothing better to talk about?

CAROL.  Where you been?

ADELE.  Yeah, you're real concerned.

\emph{Adele fiddles with a serving spoon.}

ADELE.  Did you even save me some??

GRANT.  There's more.

\emph{Grant gets up and goes over by Adele.  Adele reaches for the whisky.}

ADELE.  Y'all are sloppy.  Lemme try that---

\emph{Jeff grabs the bottle from her.}

ADELE.  Hey!

\emph{Grant spoons some green beans onto Adele's plate.}

GRANT.  Don't scare us like that next time.

\section*{EXT. LOG CABIN - DUSK}

\emph{Jeff throws the fly over a tent he's pitched outside the cabin.  Adele stands watching Grant chop wood with splitting maul.  Jeff watches Adele.}

JEFF.  Better get your sleep.

ADELE.  Ain't tired.

JEFF.  I don't want to hear no complaining tomorrow.

\emph{Grant sets a piece of wood on a stump.}

GRANT.  Stand back, honeypot.

\emph{Adele doesn't move.  Grant reels the maul above his shoulders, and brings its blade down, splintering the wood in pieces.}

\section*{INT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT}

\emph{A two-room log cabin.  In the main room, the last embers of a fire glow in the fireplace.  Adele sleeps in a sleeping bag by the fire.  The cabin door opens.  Jeff comes in.  He goes to Adele and switches on his flashlight.  He kneels beside her, looks at her for a minute.  He puts his hand on her body and shakes her gently.  His flashlight is in her face.  Adele wakes.}

JEFF.  Why aren't you dressed?

ADELE.  If I'm not mistaken I just woke up.

JEFF.  Well let's go.

ADELE.  Give me five minutes.

JEFF.  You've got three and I'm leaving.

\emph{Jeff goes outside.  Adele gets out of the sleeping bag.  She's already dressed.  She puts on hiking boots and a wool cap.  She grabs a slim backpack and heads for the door.}

\section*{EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT}

\emph{There are fifteen fishing rods of various types set against the side of the cabin; Adele takes two of the rods and runs away from the cabin.  She switches on a flashlight.  Jeff is already walking away from the cabin toward the edge of the clearing.}

ADELE.  Hold up a second.

JEFF.  Shh.  Let your parents sleep in if they want to.

\emph{She catches up with Jeff.  He carries two fishing rods and a large yellow tackle box.  The two of them walk side-by-side away from the cabin and into the woods.}

ADELE.  At least they get to sleep in.

JEFF.  But do they get the good fishin?

ADELE.  Hah.

\section*{EXT. WOODED PATH - NIGHT}

\emph{Adele and Jeff walk single-file, Adele leading the way.  They're headed downhill.}

JEFF.  Whatcha guessing?

ADELE.  I'm guessing pike.

\emph{Adele reaches around and scratches her hip.  Jeff watches as her fingers reach below the waistline of her pants in order to do this.}

JEFF.  You never caught pike.

\emph{Adele stops and faces him.  She makes her eyes big and pouty.}

ADELE.  Yes I did.

JEFF.  When?

ADELE.  Upstate.  Last summer.

JEFF.  What kinda line?  Huh?  What kinda line?

\emph{Adele turns and starts walking again.}

ADELE.  I ain't telling.

JEFF.  You never caught no pike.

ADELE.  Just cause I won't tell you what kinda line don't mean I didn't catch em.

JEFF.  Whatever you say then, li'l miss.

\emph{Adele shakes her head.}

ADELE.  Fine, if you don't believe me \ldots

JEFF.  I'm sorry, I don't.

ADELE.  Forget it.  What are you guessing?

JEFF.  I'm guessing topwater.  Early morning.  Bass.  That's my guess.  You fish topwater?

ADELE.  Naw.

JEFF.  Fly?

ADELE.  Dad was gonna teach me, but--

\emph{Adele stops walking and turns around.  Jeff stops too.}

JEFF.  What?

\emph{Adele points to the ground between them.  There's a dead snake, belly up, lying across the path.}

ADELE.  Walk around.  It's bad luck if you step over him.

JEFF.  You stepped over him.

ADELE.  \emph{(gravely)} I know, but walk around.  I don't want us both to have bad luck.

\emph{Jeff goes around the snake.  Adele pokes him in the side with her finger as he goes past her.}

\section*{EXT. DOCK - NIGHT}

\emph{A wooden boat dock on the edge of a lake.  Tied to a post at its end is a three-man rowboat with an outboard motor.  Adele and Jeff put their gear into boat.  Adele gets in the boat and fiddles with the motor.}

ADELE.  It's only half a tank.

JEFF.  How far you planning on taking us?

ADELE.  I ain't for sure, but \ldots  Toss that oar this way, willya?

\emph{Jeff brings her an oar that was sitting on the dock.  He takes a flask from his pocket and swigs.  Adele sees.}

JEFF.  Want some?

ADELE.  I'll pass.

JEFF.  I know you drink when you sneak out with your friends, don't tell me you never drank.

\emph{Adele reclines/leans on the motor.  She's either being guarded or maybe she's doing it to show off her body.}

ADELE.  Beer.  With my friends.

JEFF.  Just beer?

\emph{Adele gets up and goes over to Jeff.  She stands right up close, and with a posture that usually nieces don't usually make when standing right up close to their uncles.}

ADELE.  We drink Jack Daniel's at Macey's house.

\emph{She grabs his flask.}

ADELE.  What's this?

JEFF.  Whisky.  Try it.

\emph{She hands him back the flask.}

ADELE.  I'll pass.

JEFF.  But you drink Jack Daniel's.

ADELE.  Sometimes.

JEFF.  With your friends.

ADELE.  You got a problem?

JEFF.  No.  You got a problem with me knocking it back while we fish?

ADELE.  Don't matter to me.  Guess I'm driving.  Get in if you're coming!

JEFF.  Alright, alright, I'm in, I'm in.

\emph{Adele shakes her head: ``that's pathetic''.  Jeff steps into the boat.}

ADELE.  Now you're in.  You wanna work on sitting down for me?  I like to drive real crazy.

JEFF.  That's what I hear.

ADELE.  And who told you that?

JEFF.  Nobody.

ADELE.  Well, Nobody has a big mouth, and I would advise you not to listen.

\emph{Adele rips the cord on the outboard and the motor starts.}

\section*{EXT. DOCK - NIGHT}

\emph{The boat motors full speed away from the dock toward the center of the lake.}

JEFF.  Know what else nobody says?

ADELE.  If nobody says it then why would I want to hear about it?

JEFF.  \emph{(sing-songy)} Nobody \ldots says \ldots it's that time of the month for you---!

ADELE.  He did not tell you that.

JEFF.  Nobody tells me everything.

ADELE.  Nobody needs to shut the fuck up.

\section*{EXT. LAKE - NIGHT}

\emph{The boat motors quietly across the lake.}

ADELE.  I don't think you're gonna have much luck with topwater.

JEFF.  Take a swig of this.

ADELE.  Get that out of my face.

JEFF.  Just take a sip.

ADELE.  I can't.  I'm driving.

\section*{EXT. BOAT - NIGHT}

\emph{The boats appears to sit still on the surface of the lake.  The motor is off.  Adele sits in the rear of the boat by the motor.  Jeff sits on the bench up front.  Adele reaches in her backpack and pulls out a small black tackle box.  Jeff offers her the flask.}

JEFF.  Take a swig.

ADELE.  My parents'll smell it.

JEFF.  Nah they won't.  You're gonna be so smelled up with fish they ain't gonna notice no little swig.

ADELE.  I ain't thirsty.

\emph{Jeff holds the flask out to her.}

JEFF.  Take one swig.

\emph{Adele flashes her eyes at him.}

ADELE.  I said I ain't thirsty.

\emph{Jeff drinks again.}

ADELE.  You gonna do any fishing on this fishing trip?

\emph{Jeff opens his tackle box and selects a topwater lure.  He fastens the lure to the line on one of his rods.  Adele clips a large hook to the end of a chain and drops it over the side of the boat.  She shines a flashlight on the hook, which she keeps three feet below the surface.}

JEFF.  You are aware that spotlighting's illegal in this state.

ADELE.  Who's gonna catch us?

\emph{Adele takes a can of multicolored glitter from her bag; the can has a perforated lid.  She shakes glitter into the water; it falls along the chain, passing the hook.}

JEFF.  Glitter?!  I am fishing with a girl.

ADELE.  What are you using?

\emph{He casts his line.}

JEFF.  Hula popper.

\emph{Jeff reels his bait in, quick spurts.  The bait creates bubbles on the top of the water.}

ADELE.  That's the gayest shit I've ever seen.  ``Hula popper''?

JEFF.  Glitter and a chain \ldots

ADELE.  We'll just see then.  We'll just see.

JEFF.  Your dad know you use that shit?  You better hope no ranger comes along.

ADELE.  Ain't no rangers up here.  I'll make you a deal, Mr.: you get first catch I'll take a swig of that.

JEFF.  That's some kinda deal for me!  I get first catch and I have to give you a swig!

ADELE.  You're practically dying to give me one.

\emph{He fishes to see if she's insinuating what he thinks she's insinuating:}

JEFF.  Dying to give you one?

\emph{She leans in to him and replies sensuously:}

ADELE.  Yeah.

\emph{He takes it back to above-board, looking away from her, breaking her stare:}

JEFF.  I was just tryin to show some politeness.  That's all.

ADELE.  Well, if you want to be polite, keep your voice down.  You're scaring away my fish.

\emph{Jeff moves to her bench; now he's sitting beside her.}

JEFF.  Oh, your fish?  You little prude.

ADELE.  That's right, my fish.  Like I ever saw anyone catch anything with a hula popper.  Why am I a prude?

JEFF.  Cause you won't drink.

ADELE.  If I was drinking I bet you'd be complaining that I was hogging up all your whiskey.

\emph{Jeff grabs Adele's wrist.}

JEFF.  No.  You're just scared.

ADELE.  Of what?

\emph{He lets her wrist go.}

JEFF.  Of it messing up your game.

ADELE.  I'm not scared.

JEFF.  Well, we'll see who gets first catch then.

ADELE.  Shhh!  Gimme that.

\emph{She grabs his flask and takes a swig.  She hands it back to him.}

ADELE.  So disgusting.

\emph{Jeff re-casts his line.  Adele pours more glitter into the water above her hook.  FADE TO:}

\section*{EXT. BOAT---DAWN}

\emph{They're still sitting on the same bench by the motor.  The flask lies empty on the floor of the boat.  Jeff's line is in the water.  Adele pulls her chain and hook into the boat.  She turns around to the motor.}

ADELE.  Slide up front.

\emph{She puts her hand on the motor's rip cord.  Jeff grabs her hand to stop her.}

JEFF.  My line!

ADELE.  Bring it in.

\emph{She pulls her hands out of his grasp.}

JEFF.  Where we going?

ADELE.  Pee break.

JEFF.  Go over the side.

ADELE.  Yeah right.

JEFF.  Row us in, at least.  You'll scare the fish.

ADELE.  There ain't no fish out here.

JEFF.  There might be.  You start the motor, we'll never know.

ADELE.  Too bad.  Bring it in.

\emph{He starts bringing his line in.}

ADELE.  Slide up front.

\emph{He stands up to move to the front bench.  She rips the cord.  The engine starts.  He rapidly brings in his line as the boat begins to move across the lake.}

JEFF.  We're gonna miss the fish.  This is the best time, just before daylight.

ADELE.  Just after daylight is good too.

JEFF.  I'm gonna miss my fish.

\section*{EXT. LAKE EDGE - DAWN}

\emph{Adele brings the boat up to a bank on the edge of the lake.  She pushes them right against the edge with the paddle, steps out, and ties the boat to a tree.  She starts into the woods.  Jeff gets out of the boat and starts into the woods.  Adele stops and turns to Jeff.}

ADELE.  What are you doing?

JEFF.  I gotta go too.

\section*{EXT. WOODS - DAWN}

\emph{Adele hikes up the incline away from the lake.  She looks behind her.  Jeff is following her up the slope.}

ADELE.  Leave me some privacy while I go!

JEFF.  Wanna make sure you don't get lost.

ADELE.  Hold back a bit.

JEFF.  Go on then.

\emph{She starts on.  He starts on after.}

ADELE.  Whatcha doing now?

JEFF.  Don't want you to get lost.

\emph{Adele finds it absurd that he might think she could get lost while she's this close to the lake, the boat still clearly visible.}

ADELE.  How I'm gonna get lost?  Meet me at the boat.

JEFF.  I told you: I gotta go too.

ADELE.  And you gotta go standin right next to me?  Why is that?

\emph{He's caught up with her.}

ADELE.  I ain't going with you standing there.

JEFF.  What if I lose you?  Your dad'd kill me.

ADELE.  He won't kill you for standing ten steps away while I pee.

JEFF.  Just go.

ADELE.  Turn around, at least.

JEFF.  Arright \ldots go so we can get back to fishin.

\emph{He turns around, three feet away from her, starts to unzip.  She turns around and looks at him skeptically.}

ADELE.  I don't want you pissing right on top of me!

JEFF.  Arright.  But don't be running off.

\emph{He walks.  He stops fifteen yards away, unzips, and pisses on a tree.  Through the trees, he sees Adele squat, looking nervously over at him.}

\section*{EXT. ROWBOAT - DAY}

\emph{They're back in the boat.  Adele sits on the bench by the motor.  Jeff sits on the bench up front.  Adele's chain is in the water.  She casts a weighted line overboard.  Jeff isn't fishing.}

JEFF.  Your daddy says you got a boyfriend.

ADELE.  He did not.

JEFF.  Sure he did.  Said when they come home they find you two sneaking around in the basement, making sounds.

\emph{She shoots him a look.}

ADELE.  I've never even done anything with him.

JEFF.  Nothing?

\emph{They fish.}

JEFF.  You wanna hear how your daddy and mommy first did it, at your momma's birthday party over Danny Madsen's place---

ADELE.  No.

JEFF.  Your mom, she come out looking like a snake bit her---

ADELE.  Shut up!

JEFF.  White.  Like a ghost.

ADELE.  \emph{(disapprovingly)} And y'all standing there watchin.

JEFF.  You bet.  That was a big party we had on that one.  We'd been planning that for weeks.

ADELE.  Mom says y'all surprised her.

JEFF.  Bullshit!  She's the one who planned it.  Talking for weeks about how she's gonna lose her virginity to Grant Ford.  Grant Ford, Grant Ford, every word outta that girl's mouth was about Grant Ford.  We was tired of hearing her run her mouth, that was why we planned it.

ADELE.  Who planned it then, y'all or her?

JEFF.  We all planned it together.  No big deal.  Just picked a night and got a case of beer.  Went over Danny Madsen's and we sat outside while the two of them go in Danny's bedroom, close the door.  Didn't take em long!  Twenty minutes, they were done.

ADELE.  That is not how it happened.

JEFF.  Oh yeah?

ADELE.  Which birthday was it then?

JEFF.  That was fifteen.

ADELE.  That is not how it happened.

JEFF.  You ask your momma.

ADELE.  I will.

JEFF.  She won't admit it.  She'll be scared you'll try the same thing.  What's the name of your boy?

ADELE.  He's not my boy.

JEFF.  What's his name.

ADELE.  Matthew.

\emph{They fish.}

JEFF.  Your other friends do it yet?

ADELE.  Like I know!

JEFF.  I know you know.  Course you know.  You and your little girlfriends that'll be the first thing y'all tell each other.

ADELE.  I don't hang out with girls.

JEFF.  Sure you do.

ADELE.  I don't.  They all hate me.

JEFF.  That Rachel Walker girl, she's your friend.

ADELE.  Not anymore.

JEFF.  What happened?  She sweet on Matthew?

ADELE.  Like he'd ever go for her.

JEFF.  You watch her.  She's willing to give it up before you, you might have a hard time predicting what little Matthew'll do.  How far'd you go with him?

ADELE.  None of your business.

JEFF.  You watch that Rachel.  Slut like that'll come along and temptation for Matthew gets too strong \ldots boys can only resist so much.

\emph{Adele brings her line in.}

ADELE.  Well \ldots

\emph{Jeff looks at her like ``what?''.}

ADELE.  She is a slut.

\emph{Jeff laughs.  He shifts to Adele's bench.}

ADELE.  She already fucked half the school.

\emph{Jeff viciously slings his arms around Adele: one around her waist and one around her neck.}

JEFF.  \emph{(grabbing her)} I ain't surprised.

\emph{His face is one inch from hers.}

JEFF.  Did you fuck the other half?

\emph{Adele screams but Jeff covers her mouth.}

JEFF.  Now now.  Keep it quiet.  This ain't no thing.

\emph{He keeps one arm around her neck and covering her mouth.  With the one that was around her waist, he reaches up and gropes one of her breasts.  She elbows him in the stomach.  It knocks the wind out of him.  She scrambles to the front of the boat.  He recovers.  She digs in her backpack and pulls out a knife.}

ADELE.  I will cut you.

\emph{He moves toward her.}

JEFF.  Whatcha gonna cut me for?

ADELE.  \emph{(screams)} I will cut you and leave you here!

\emph{Jeff makes a motion with his hands that means ``there's no problem here, you don't need to do that''.}

JEFF.  Okay.  Okay.  I was just trying to show you something.

ADELE.  You don't touch me!

JEFF.  I ain't touching you.  Shit.  There ain't no fish out here.  Let's go.

\emph{Adele keeps the knife pointed in Jeff's direction.  She's shaking with anger.}

JEFF.  Drive us home.  Go on.  Drive us home.

\emph{He starts toward the front of the boat.  Adele threatens him with the knife:}

ADELE.  You drive.

\emph{Jeff stops.}

JEFF.  But you're a better driver than me.

ADELE.  \emph{(sharp)} You can drive a boat!

\emph{Jeff takes another step toward Adele.}

ADELE.  I will cut you if you come any closer.

\emph{He stops.}

JEFF.  Jhesus!  What's got you so serious all of a sudden?

\emph{He sits.}

JEFF.  Fine, ya spoilsport, I'll drive.

\emph{She sits, keeping the knife handy.  He rips the cord.  The motor starts and the boat begins to move.  FADE TO BLACK.  CUT TO:}

\section*{INT. LOG CABIN: MAIN ROOM - DAY}

\emph{In the main room of the log cabin, a forty-something couple, GRANT and CAROL, sit at a table drinking coffee.  Carol reads a book.  Grant wears a pointy birthday hat.  The table is covered with a red and white checkered picnic tablecloth.  On it is a birthday cake with unlit candles and a small package wrapped in festive paper.  The door to the cabin bedroom is open.  The cabin door opens.  Jeff comes in.  Adele comes in after.  Adele goes to the fireplace.  Jeff stands awkwardly in the middle of the room.}

CAROL.  We didn't forget.

\emph{Grant hugs Adele chummily.}

GRANT.  How was it out there?

\emph{An awkward silence: Adele shrugs out of Grant's embrace.  Grant looks to Adele, who walks to the fireplace staring at her shoes.  Grant looks to Jeff; Jeff shrugs.}

GRANT.  Slow morning?

JEFF.  There ain't no fish out there.

\emph{Grant goes to Adele and puts his arm around her.}

GRANT.  Even for The Expert?

\emph{Adele winces away from Grant.}

ADELE.  He's right.  There ain't no fish out there.

GRANT.  Did you use the chain?

ADELE.  There ain't no fish in that lake.

\emph{Grant goes back to the kitchen area.  He picks up the present.}

GRANT.  Wanna find out what's in here?

\emph{Adele responds forcefully, quieting the room:}

ADELE.  No.

\emph{Grant puts the present on the table.}

GRANT.  Maybe we can all go out later and try again.  They're probably just slow starters.  Anyone hungry for some breakfast?

ADELE.  What are we gonna eat?

GRANT.  How about some sausage and eggs.

ADELE.  I wanted to bring in some fish \ldots

CAROL.  Relax, honey.

GRANT.  We'll try again this afternoon.

CAROL.  There's plenty of time for fishing.

GRANT.  Babe, why don't you help me out with breakfast \ldots set some dishes out?

\emph{Adele doesn't move.}

GRANT.  Come on.  We'll have fish for dinner, I betcha.

\emph{Adele goes to the kitchen area and starts setting dishes out on the table.  She speaks quietly to her dad:}

ADELE.  I need to talk to you.

\emph{He is oblivious to the fact that she's trying to keep their interchange low-key.}

GRANT.  Okay.

\emph{Jeff is watching Adele like a hawk.  Carol is absorbed in her book.  Grant is getting sausage and eggs out of an ice chest.  Adele makes another attempt to get her dad's attention:}

\emph{Outside the log cabin, Carol lies in a folding chair, sunbathing, reading.  Jeff and Grant toss a frisbee.  Adele comes out of the cabin with a bucket of food garbage.  When Adele comes out, Jeff shifts his frisbee position closer to Adele and Carol.}

ADELE.  Mom, let's go.  Too much of that book.  You need some exercise.

\emph{Her mom looks at her blankly.  Adele takes the book.}

CAROL.  Hey!

ADELE.  Let's spend some time together.  Isn't that what we're supposed to be doing?

\emph{Carol takes the book back.}

CAROL.  What we're supposed to be doing \ldots is relaxing \ldots in whatever way works for each of us.

ADELE.  Walk with me to the lake.  You can read on the way.

CAROL.  I'm fine right here.

\emph{Adele goes near Grant, toting the garbage bag.}

ADELE.  Where do you want this?

GRANT.  Just take it out a little ways and bury it.

ADELE.  Come show me where you want it.

GRANT.  Honey, wait till we're done, okay?

JEFF.  What does she want?

ADELE.  None of your business!

JEFF.  Okay, okay, little missy.

ADELE.  Just show me this once.

GRANT.  \emph{(snapping at her)} You can't bury some trash?

\emph{Carol and Adele both look at him, surprised.}

GRANT.  Alright.

\emph{Grant tosses the frisbee to Jeff.  Jeff looks at Adele flatly, an expression that shows nothing.  Grant starts away from the cabin area with Adele.}

GRANT.  I wish you could wait till we're done.

ADELE.  Well I can't wait.

\section*{EXT. WOODS - DAY}

\emph{Beyond sight of the cabin, Adele leads the way with the trash bucket.  Her dad is right behind.  They're walking uphill.}

GRANT.  This is fine, honey!

ADELE.  I wanna go a little farther.

GRANT.  This is fine!

\emph{Adele turns around.  Her face is red, her eyes wild.  Grant stops walking.}

GRANT.  What's the matter?

ADELE.  I'm working up to tell you, but I ain't ready yet!

GRANT.  Adele, honey, what's wrong?

ADELE.  I'll tell you when I'm ready.

GRANT.  You're scaring me.  I wish you would talk to me.

\emph{Grant hugs his daughter comfortingly.  She puts the bucket down.  He holds her tight.}

GRANT.  If you have something you want to talk about, I'm listening.

\emph{Adele pulls away from his hug.  She looks away from his gaze, intentionally avoiding eye contact.}

ADELE.  Uncle Jeff grabbed me in the boat this morning.

\emph{Grant looks surprised, confused.}

GRANT.  Grabbed you?  How?

ADELE.  He grabbed me.

GRANT.  How?

ADELE.  He grabbed my tit!

\emph{Grant backs off.  He thinks.  When he speaks again he is softer, gentler.}

GRANT.  Are you sure?

ADELE.  What do you mean?

GRANT.  Did he mean to?  Did he just accidentally---

ADELE.  This wasn't no accident!

GRANT.  That's a small boat.  Your uncle \ldots he \ldots what exactly?  \ldots he wouldn't do \ldots what exactly are we talking about here?  Did he \ldots  Did he lean on you?  Something like that?

\emph{Silence between them.  Then:}

GRANT.  Did you tease him?

ADELE.  What do you mean?

GRANT.  Well.  Honey, sometimes \ldots  With your friends.  Like with that O'Leary boy \ldots  Sometimes you have a tendency to \ldots

\emph{Adele looks at him incredulously.}

ADELE.  To what?

GRANT.  Well, honey.  Sometimes you tease.

ADELE.  I didn't tease him.

GRANT.  But maybe---

ADELE.  I didn't tease him.

GRANT.  ---you might have and just not known it---

ADELE.  I didn't!

GRANT.  Listen.  Listen to me.  How can you be sure?

\emph{Adele looks at her dad as though he was a stranger.  She's completely shocked: she revealed something difficult to reveal and she's getting no support, maybe not even belief.  She starts walking away from her dad, down the hill, like someone who just survived a car wreck (in shock).  Her dad is left standing with the trash bucket.}

GRANT.  Adele!  Adele, honey \ldots

\emph{He picks up the trash bucket and follows.}

GRANT.  Adele.  Listen \ldots

\section*{EXT. DOCK - DAY}

\emph{At the boat dock where Adele and Jeff pushed off that morning, Carol lays out in the sun, reading.  Adele sits on one of the dock posts, her eyes covered with sunglasses.  Jeff and Grant fool around thus: they take turns jumping off the dock into the lake, the other one tossing the frisbee from the dock into the air, which the jumper tries to catch.  The boat is tied to the side of the dock.  Jeff jumps off the dock.  Grant throws the frisbee fast at Jeff, but Jeff misses, and the frisbee flies a good ways across the lake.}

JEFF.  What the hell was that?

GRANT.  I guess you need to work on your catching.

JEFF.  I ain't swimming out to get that.

GRANT.  I'll race you.

\emph{Grant dives in the water.  He comes up a few yards past Jeff.}

JEFF.  The hell you will!

\emph{They swim out to the frisbee.}

ADELE.  Mom.

\emph{Adele shakes her mom's shoulder.}

CAROL.  What?

ADELE.  Mom I need to tell you something.

\emph{Carol keeps reading.  When she speaks it is as though her mind is a long way away.}

CAROL.  Well.  Tell me.

ADELE.  Jeff touched me on the boat this morning.

\emph{Carol doesn't respond.}

ADELE.  Mom.

CAROL.  What?

ADELE.  Did you lose your virginity at a birthday party at Danny Madsen's house?

\emph{Carol lowers her book.}

CAROL.  Who told you that?

ADELE.  This morning, while we were fishing, Jeff touched me.

CAROL.  How did that happen?

ADELE.  What do you mean?

CAROL.  What events transpired that led up the moment when he touched you?

ADELE.  Nothing.  Mom.  Mom.

CAROL.  What do you want me to do?

ADELE.  You don't care that he touched me?

CAROL.  It's not that I don't care, it's just \ldots  Baby you make it very difficult to know what to do in situations like this.  Have you ever heard of the little boy who cried wolf?

ADELE.  When did I cry wolf?

CAROL.  Okay, that's a bad analogy---

ADELE.  Mom, I want you to keep him away from me.  Okay?

\emph{Carol gestures to mean ``look around you, look how big this place is, how can I control anything within it?''.}

CAROL.  How am I supposed to do that?

ADELE.  Just keep him away.

CAROL.  Watch who you're ordering around.

\emph{Adele gets up from her mom's chair, goes back to sitting on the dock post.  After a while Carol speaks without looking over at Adele.}

CAROL.  Your father told me what you told him this morning.

\emph{Adele is wrapt.}

CAROL.  He said he talked to Jeff and Jeff says you leaned over him in the boat, you accidentally touched him, you got a little freaked out over it and started screaming at him saying he touched you.

\emph{Adele is shocked, silent.}

CAROL.  Don't you give that uncle of yours any trouble.  He likes you.

\emph{Grant and uncle Jeff are back.  They get up on the dock.}

CAROL.  What happened to your little toy?

\emph{They shrug.}

GRANT.  Lost.

\section*{EXT. LAKE - DAY}

\emph{Adele swims by herself, some ways from the dock.  Carol is still sunning/reading on the dock.  Jeff sits on a dock post near Carol.  Adele isn't sure of what she sees: Jeff touches Carol's bare leg?  She looks more carefully.  Jeff's hand is on her mother's leg.  Carol smiles at him and playfully slaps his hand.  Jeff goes in again with a firmer grab.  Carol says \ldots}

CAROL.  Not now!

\emph{\ldots and bats his hand away.  He shrinks back.  She reaches out to him, pulls him close, pulls him into a kiss.  Adele puts her goggles on and dives underneath the water.  Grant comes quickly out of the woods, carrying a beach ball.  Carol and Jeff are no longer kissing, and they make a show of welcoming Grant.  Grant runs off the edge of the dock, tossing the beach ball in the air.  Jeff chases him off the edge of the dock; they fight for the ball in the air, then splash into the lake.  Adele watches them.}

GRANT.  Come on in!

ADELE.  That's arright.

JEFF.  We need three to play.

ADELE.  I don't wanna play.

GRANT.  Come on, baby, toss the ball with us!

JEFF.  You chicken?

ADELE.  I ain't chicken!  You shut up.

CAROL.  Adele.

ADELE.  Tell him not to call me chicken.

JEFF.  You are a chicken!

CAROL.  Jeff.  Cool it.

JEFF.  But we need three to play.

CAROL.  Well she ain't gonna play if she don't want to.

JEFF.  You then.

CAROL.  I can't right now.

GRANT.  Come on, honey.

Carol puts down her book.

CAROL.  What's the game?

GRANT.  Keepaway.

\emph{Carol stands up.}

CAROL.  \emph{(sarcastically)} My favorite.

\emph{Carol puts on her swimming cap and dives into the lake.  Adele stands up.  Alone on the dock, she moves to the spot where her mother just dove from and stands awkwardly.}

GRANT.  Come on in, baby.

JEFF.  Don't be a---

CAROL.  Jeff!  I mean it now.  Come on, sweetie, help me out against these boys.

\emph{Adele looks doubtfully at her mother.}

CAROL.  Fine!  You gonna leave me all alone against these two?

\emph{Adele goes back a few steps, then runs and jumps into the water.  The guys are on the outside, girls in the middle.  They play keepaway.  Adele is tentative at first, then, as her mom is having trouble getting the ball, Adele gets more agressive.}

GRANT.  Game on!

JEFF.  Whoa!  Here ya go.

CAROL.  Ahh!

GRANT.  Nice try, honey.

CAROL.  No it wasn't.

JEFF.  That was pitiful.

ADELE.  Don't say that.

CAROL.  It's okay, sweetie.

JEFF.  Catch this!

GRANT.  Oh!  Spiked!

JEFF.  Denied.  Heads up!

GRANT.  Okay.  A floater.

\emph{Grant tosses to Jeff.  Adele is near Jeff.  She jumps up and snags the ball.  As she dips into the water from her jump, she comes down right by Jeff.  Under the water, Jeff's hand goes to Adele.  He puts his hand on her exposed leg very near her crotch.  Adele screams and thwacks Jeff in the head.  His hands go up to feel his reddened face.  Adele is swimming for the dock.}

CAROL.  Honey!

JEFF.  I'm gonna get you back for that.

CAROL.  \emph{(to Jeff)} What happened?

JEFF.  Nothing.

CAROL.  Honey!  Wha'd you do that for?

\emph{Carol looks at Grant.  Grant returns with a look that means ``I don't know \ldots you got me''.  Adele reaches the dock and hefts herself up.  She turns around.  She shakes with rage.  Her eyes say murder.  Everyone in the water is looking at her, unable to speak.  Adele turns and runs into the woods.}

CAROL.  Adele!

GRANT.  Baby, come back \ldots

CAROL.  \emph{(to Jeff)} What happened?

JEFF.  I told you nothing.

CAROL.  You sure it was nothing?

JEFF.  Yeah!

\emph{Carol watches Adele disappear into the woods.  Carol looks at Grant.}

\section*{INT. LOG CABIN - DAY}

\emph{Carol comes in, still wet from the lake.  Adele isn't in the room.}

CAROL.  Adele!

\emph{Carol looks into the bedroom.  Adele isn't there.  Grant and then Jeff come into the cabin.}

CAROL.  You go find her.

\emph{Grant nods.}

CAROL.  You find her.

GRANT.  Arright.  Arright.

\emph{Grant pushes out the door past Jeff.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - DUSK}

\emph{Grant and Jeff walk through the woods.  Jeff drinks a beer.  They reach the top of a ridge.  Grant cups his hands around his mouth and yells:}

GRANT.  Adele!

\emph{He waits a bit and yells again.}

GRANT.  Adele!

\emph{Grant starts walking.}

JEFF.  Listen---

GRANT.  I don't want to know.

\emph{Jeff follows behind Grant.}

JEFF.  You don't?

\emph{In a single movement Grant stops walking, turns, and grabs Jeff by his jacket.  Jeffs beer falls.  Grant yells in Jeff's face.}

GRANT.  DID I SAY YOU COULD TOUCH HER?  WHEN DID I SAY THAT?

\emph{Grant loosens his grip on Jeff.  Jeff recovers.  Grant calms.}

GRANT.  Come on.

\emph{Grant turns and starts walking.}

GRANT.  We got other things to worry about now.

\emph{Jeff follows.}

\section*{EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT}

\emph{The door to the cabin is open.  Carol sits outside, hunched over, staring into the woods.  Grant comes from within the cabin, kneels beside his wife.  He puts his hand on her shoulder.  She reels from him.}

CAROL.  What the fuck did he do to her!?!

GRANT.  Honey---

CAROL.  Tell me what happened!

GRANT.  Nothing happened---

CAROL.  You know!  I know you know!

\emph{Grant tries to comfort her again.  She faces him straight on, vicious mother hen:}

CAROL.  You two stay away from her.

GRANT.  Don't get hysterical.  She'll come back when she's ready.

\emph{Carol glares at her husband: daggers.}

CAROL.  You stay away from her.

\emph{Carol goes back to the cabin.  Grant follows.}

\section*{INT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT}

\emph{Grant, Carol, and Jeff are sitting at the table looking at their dinner.  Grant and Jeff exchange glances.  Carol pushes a green bean around her plate.  A propane lantern burns, the combustion of its gas making a loud ``hhohhhh'' sound.  The cabin door opens.  Adele comes in.  She's still wearing her swimsuit.  Her legs are dusty.  Carol stands up.  Adele looks at the threesome blankly.  She goes to the fireplace and picks up her duffel bag.  She goes into the bedroom and closes the door.}

\section*{INT. LOG CABIN: BEDROOM - NIGHT}

\emph{Adele pulls a pair of cargo pants out of her duffel bag.  She rummages through it and pulls out a plain white tshirt.}

CAROL.  \emph{(O.S.)} When she comes out of there I want an apology from you.  And make it a nice one.

GRANT.  \emph{(O.S.)} He doesn't have to apologize.

JEFF.  \emph{(O.S.)} No, it's okay.  She's right.

\section*{INT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT}

\emph{Adele comes out of the bedroom.  She sits down at the place that has been set for her at the table.  She serves herself some mashed potatoes.  Jeff struggles for the words to say.  Adele watches him struggle.}

JEFF.  Look---

ADELE.  Whatever it is I don't care.

GRANT.  Honey---

CAROL.  Now you listen---

ADELE.  I don't wanna---

CAROL.  Listen.

\emph{Jeff re-musters his linguistic powers.}

JEFF.  I \ldots when \ldots whatever you thought \ldots this morning \ldots whatever you thought I meant to do, that's not what I meant to do.

CAROL.  Thank you.

ADELE.  What about this afternoon---?

CAROL.  Enough---

ADELE.  In the lake---

CAROL.  He said he's sorry.

ADELE.  I never knew that was part of keepaway---

CAROL.  We're finished now.  That's the end of it.  He said he's sorry, now don't you blow it.

\emph{Adele stares at her plate.}

section*{INT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT}

\emph{The dishes have been cleared.  A fire is burning in the fireplace.  The foursome sits at the table playing cards.  Adele's unopened birthday present sits out on the card table.}

GRANT.  She's shootin' the moon, I'm tellin you, she's shootin' the moon.

\emph{Adele does something almost like a smile.}

GRANT.  Don't let her take that one, if you can take it.  Stop her.

CAROL.  You stop her.

GRANT.  I can't.  I wish I could.

CAROL.  Are you shooting the moon?

JEFF.  Jes' play, arright.  She ain't gonna tell you.

CAROL.  \emph{(to Jeff)} She's got a card face, just like her father.  \emph{(to Adele)} That's nothing like your grandaddy.  You know what he would do?  He'll sit there and let on like he don't know how to play, asking questions like ``What was that rule again?'' when he damn well knows that rule.  Knows it like the day he was born.  Just to throw you off your guard.

JEFF.  You gonna play?

CAROL.  Oh.  Is it my turn?

JEFFGRANT.  Yes.Yes.

CAROL.  Arright.

\emph{She plays a card.  Adele picks up the trick.}

\emph{Grant picks up Adele's birthday present.}

GRANT.  Are you gonna open this?

ADELE.  It's the same thing every year!

\emph{Grant puts the package down.}

GRANT.  How are me and Jeff supposed to catch anything without The Expert there to show us the techniques?

ADELE.  You don't need me.

GRANT.  Yes we do, honey.  You know Jeff can't fish worth a crap.

\emph{Adele hides a smile.}

GRANT.  And I'm okay but I'm nothin' compared to your glitter and your chain and all---

GRANT.  Pardon me.

\emph{Grant plays a card.}

GRANT.  What are we gonna eat if you don't catch us some fish?

ADELE.  What's wrong with 'tatoes and green beans?

ADELE.  Ain't gonna catch no salmon in that lake.

\emph{Jeff comes right up on Grant.  They're four feet apart, each man with a rifle in the other's face.}

GRANT.  I'm your brother.

\emph{Jeff takes another step in, brushing past the tip of Grant's gun.}

JEFF.  I know.

\emph{Jeff whacks Grant with the butt of his gun, knocking him out.  Grant falls to the ground.  Adele starts to run away.  Jeff hears her.  He turns around and fires a shot into the air.  The sound makes Adele hit the ground.  Jeff points the rifle at Grant.}

JEFF.  If you want your daddy to live you better come on back here, now.

\emph{Adele shifts so she can see Jeff and her dad.}

JEFF.  Come on.

\section*{EXT. WOODS: SEMI-CLEARING - DUSK \ldots NIGHT}

\emph{Grant is tied to a tree.  Jeff sits close by with one of the rifles resting on his lap, pointed at his brother.  Adele sits against a tree, wrapped in a hooded windbreaker.  Grant whispers so Adele can't hear:}

GRANT.  Then what is the plan?

JEFF.  The plan's changed.

GRANT.  What is it now?

JEFF.  Same as it always was.

GRANT.  This was not in the plan.

JEFF.  Maybe it was.  Maybe it's just that nobody told you.  Or \ldots maybe \ldots you just weren't listening.

GRANT.  No, I think I would have remembered this.

\emph{Adele goes to them.}

ADELE.  Y'all done playing mass-murderer?  Let's head on back so Mom can play, too.

JEFF.  Not a bad idea \ldots

GRANT.  Is this about firsts?

JEFF.  Firsts?  As in ``who's gonna get to go first?''  You're god damn right it is.

\emph{This piques Adele's interest.}

JEFF.  You're daddy's a businessman.

ADELE.  Actually, he's an English teacher.

JEFF.  Take off that jacket.  Let me see your hair.

ADELE.  And why would I do that?

\emph{He indicates the gun.}

JEFF.  Maybe cause I'm gonna kill you if you don't.

ADELE.  Try again, fuckface.

GRANT.  Adele---

JEFF.  I don't think your daddy explained the plan to you.  Go on.  Lemme see that hair.

\emph{Adele turns her back on Jeff and starts away.}

JEFF.  Girl, you have been misinformed.

ADELE.  Oh yeah?

GRANT.  Listen up, Adele---

ADELE.  Y'all play your game.

\emph{Jeff turns to Grant.}

JEFF.  She definitely don't know the plan.

\emph{Jeff aims the rifle at Grant.  It's barrel is two feet from Grant's leg.  He pulls the trigger.  Grant yells out in pain.  Adele screams, turns.  Jeff points the gun at Grant's head.}

JEFF.  Now take off that jacket.

\emph{Adele sees he's serious, but she doesn't move.  Grant moans and winces.}

JEFF.  Take.  off.  the jacket.

\emph{With shaky hands, Adele unzips the windbreaker.}

JEFF.  All the way off.

\emph{She takes it all the way off and drops it on the ground beside her.}

JEFF.  Now take off the rest of them clothes.

\emph{She hesitates.}

JEFF.  If you don't do it all I have to do is pull this trigger one more time.

GRANT.  Just do it.

\emph{Adele shakes, shivers; she's petrified with shock.}

GRANT.  Do it!

\emph{Adele takes off her shoes.  Her socks are still on.}

JEFF.  You got a obedient girl there.

\emph{Adele grabs the bottom of her shirt.}

JEFF.  Everything, everything.

\emph{She takes off her shirt.  She is crying.}

GRANT.  It's gonna be okay, baby.  Jeff!  Lay off her, how much fun you gonna have if she's crying?

\emph{Adele hesitates at her jeans.}

JEFF.  \ldots Waiting \ldots

\emph{She unsnaps them, unzips.}

ADELE.  What did you mean about ``firsts''?

GRANT.  What??

ADELE.  ``Who gets to go first''?

JEFF.  I'm gonna shoot your daddy in the head, you don't get those pants off.

\emph{She pushes them down.}

JEFF.  Now sit down.

\emph{She sits in sticks, leaves, dirt.  Keeping the rifle on Grant, Jeff goes to Adele.  He looks at her body.}

ADELE.  \emph{(accusing)} What did he mean about who's gonna go first?

\emph{Jeff turns to Grant.}

JEFF.  Oops.  Looks like that ain't a secret anymore.

\emph{Adele reaches into her jeans, fumbles around in the pocket.}

GRANT.  He's just fucking with you \ldots there's no secret \ldots there's no plan!

JEFF.  \emph{(soberly)} It was your plan.

\emph{Adele finds the knife she had on the rowboat.  Hands shaking, she opens it.  Jeff sees this movement and turns to her.  Adele stabs him in the leg.  He cowers over, dropping the rifle.}

JEFF.  Fuck.

\emph{She scrambles around, keeping the knife between her and Jeff.  She stabs him again, this time in the shoulder.  Jeff is disoriented, but still active.  He grabs her arm.  She wrings free.  He grabs her ankle.  She kicks him in the face.  Jeff is going for the gun.}

JEFF.  You are definitely gonna pay.

\emph{Adele grabs her jeans and windbreaker and runs into the woods.  Behind her, Grant moans in pain.  Jeff follows her.}

JEFF.  Get back here.

\emph{She gets far enough away that Jeff can no longer see her.  She stumbles downhill, falling into the brush.  Jeff paces around in the dark, in the direction in which Adele ran, but he looks back at Grant and that stops him: he doesn't want to leave Grant out of sight.}

JEFF.  \emph{(yelling out to her)} You fucking whore.  You killed your daddy.  You killed your daddy.

\emph{Adele crouches in the brush, huddling her clothes to her skin, shaking, crying, but trying to be silent.  Far off, somewhere in the darkness, the howling of wolves.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - NIGHT}

\emph{Grant is still tied to the tree.  Jeff sits beside him, dressing the gunshot wound that he inflicted on Grant's leg.  He ties fabric in tight knots around the limb.}

JEFF.  You're mad, aren't you?

GRANT.  It'll heal.

JEFF.  Not about that.

\emph{Grant looks at him like: ``what then?''.}

JEFF.  Firsts.

GRANT.  Firsts?  There ain't gonna be no firsts.  Ain't gonna be no seconds either.  Dumb motherfucker.

JEFF.  Hey \ldots  I don't have to do this.  \emph{(meaning dress the wound)}

GRANT.  Fine.  Don't.

\emph{Jeff is hurt.  He stops dressing the wound.}

JEFF.  You know what?  You've got a bad attitude.

\emph{Jeff grabs both rifles and whatever other supplies he has around.}

GRANT.  And you're mentally ill.

JEFF.  Mentally ill.  Mentally ill?  That's a good one, I'm gonna have to remember that.

\emph{Jeff starts into the woods.}

JEFF.  Have fun walking back.

\emph{Jeff takes both rifles and goes off into the woods.}

GRANT.  Yeah \ldots suck it.

\section*{EXT. WOODS - NIGHT}

\emph{The full moon reflects in a medium-sized creek.  Jeff steps down the embankment.  He kneels.  He takes one of the rifles, Grant's, and lets it sink into black water.  He rises and hikes off, catlike, the hunter.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - NIGHT}

\emph{Adele runs by moonlight through the woods, in spurts.  She stops beside a tree, looks, listens.  She tries not to breathe.  She runs again.  She comes over a ridge, heads downward.  The trees thicken.  She finds her way into a scrub tree, dense, small branches, where deer like to sleep.  She stops, listens.  She sits, pulls her shirt around her head, lies down, brings her knees up to her chest, and, with effort, closes her eyes.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - NIGHT}

\emph{Adele wakes in the middle of the night, spasming with cold.  She's huddled in the thick brush.  She reflexively looks around.  Nothing.  She pulls her hood tight around her head.  Even though she is exhausted, her eyes remain open, alert.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - DAWN}

\emph{She wakes in the first blue light of morning, looks around fearfully, gets halfway up, still crouching, stealthily extracting herself from the thick patch of scrub tree.  Her first few steps are tentative, slow.  Then she abandons caution and bolts through the woods, terrified she might be followed, that she might be running the wrong way.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - DAY}

\emph{Adele comes to a creek.  She's smeared in mud from the night's sleep.  She hikes to the creek edge, then looks both directions like she's crossing a street.  She kneels and pushes her hands into the water, washing away the dirt.  She looks behind her, and, convinced she is alone, cups her hands and drinks from the stream.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - DAY}

\emph{Atop a ridge, in staggeringly beautiful sunlight, Adele walks peacefully in soiled clothes.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - DAY}

\emph{Adele hikes uphill, carefully looking around, exhausted, still actively looking to make sure she isn't being followed.  As the wood thins before her, she sees the family cabin.}

\section*{EXT. CABIN - DAY}

\emph{She comes out of the woods at the cabin.  All is quiet; there is no sign or sound of anyone.  Adele goes toward the door, but stops some distance away.}

ADELE.  Mom?

\emph{She goes to the door.}

ADELE.  Mom?

\emph{She cautiously pushes the door open.}

\section*{INT. CABIN - DAY}

\emph{Adele takes a half step inside.  She looks around.  No one is there.  She goes all the way in, leaving the front door open.  Definitely no one in the main room.  She moves to the bedroom door.}

\section*{INT. CABIN: BEDROOM - DAY}

\emph{Adele peers through the doorway.}

ADELE.  Mom?

\emph{She pushes open the bedroom door.  The room is empty.}

\section*{INT. CABIN - DAY}

\emph{Adele comes into the kitchen area and looks out a window.  No one.  Satisfied that the place is empty, she opens an ice chest and takes out bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  She makes herself a sandwich.  She gets up, goes to the front door.  She leans outside, looks around, leans back in, closes the door.  She sits, takes a bite of her food.}

\section*{INT. CABIN - NIGHT}

\emph{A fire burns in the fireplace.  Adele, still alone, sits in a lawn chair, wrapped in her sleeping bag, staring into the flames.  She gets out of the chair and spreads her sleeping bag by the hearth.  She sets her open knife on the floor, gets in the bag, zips it up.  A hand reaches out and brings the knife closer.  She pulls the bag around her head and closes her eyes.}

\section*{INT. CABIN - NIGHT}

\emph{The fire is just embers.  Adele adjusts in her sleep, wakes, sees the fire.  She sits up, reaches for another log to throw on the fire.  She finds one, puts it in.  She prods the coals with a sturdy stick.  It's end starts to glow.  She hears something and turns around.  Her uncle is sitting right behind her in the lawn chair.  His rifle is beside him.}

JEFF.  Miss me?

\emph{Adele starts, brings the glowing stick to Jeff's face.  He bats it out of her hand, grabs her, as she kicks and screams, wrestles and pins her to the floor.  He forcibly uncovers her.}

ADELE.  Where's my dad?  What did you do?

JEFF.  We're gonna have ourselves a little birthday party right here.  Just like your momma.

\emph{He rips her shirt.}

ADELE.  Where is she?!

JEFF.  You haven't seen her?  Well I don't know \ldots

ADELE.  Wha'd you do to her?

JEFF.  Looks like she left you.

ADELE.  \emph{(screaming)} Tell me where she is!!

\emph{Jeff hits Adele in the face.}

JEFF.  Quiet now.

\emph{He holds one hand over her mouth and reaches to touch her between the legs.  She hits him about the head.  The front door swings open.  It's Grant.  He limps toward the fireplace, carrying the splitting maul in both hands.  Adele backs away.  Jeff scrambles for his rifle but Grant is there with the maul.  Grant brings the blade down at his brother.  Jeff dodges.  The wedge goes into the floor.  Jeff goes for the gun.  Grant wedges the maul out of the floor and raises it.  Jeff lifts the gun.  Grant brings the maul down.  It hits Jeff where his neck meets his shoulder.  The gun goes off.  A miss.  Grant lets go the maul handle.  Jeff drops the gun, falls over.  His blood soaks the planked floor.  Grant looks like he could fall over (his leg is tied off with a shirt, he's delirious) but he goes straight for Adele.  He pins her to a wall.}

GRANT.  Did he get to you?

ADELE.  \emph{(scared, confused)} No.

GRANT.  Good.

\emph{Adele doesn't know how he means this.  Grant's hand goes for her neck: a stranglehold.  She squirms free, knocking him down.  Grant rights himself halfway, turning, going for her, but stops: She's looking at him down the barrel of Jeff's rifle, murder in her eyes.}

GRANT.  I think you've got the wrong idea.

\emph{He moves closer to her.  She pushes the muzzle into the skin below his eye and shakes her head.}

\section*{EXT. CABIN - NIGHT}

\emph{Carol comes out of the woods with a flashlight.  She looks distraught.  She approaches the cabin and goes for the door.  She opens it and goes in.}

\section*{INT. CABIN - NIGHT}

\emph{Carol enters the main room.  At the sound of the door, Adele jumps up from the lawn chair, and the rifle she's been pointing at her father swings to point to her mother.  Grant sits with his back against the wall next to the fireplace.  Carol is stunned.  Adele keeps the gun on her.}

ADELE.  Where were you!?

CAROL.  I've been out there looking for you!

\emph{Carol sees Jeff's boots peeking out from underneath a red and white checkered picnic tablecloth.  Carol covers her mouth with a hand.  Adele lowers the gun.  Carol runs for Grant.}

CAROL.  What happened?

\emph{Adele points the gun at her mom.}

ADELE.  Get back.

CAROL.  What?

ADELE.  Get back from him.

CAROL.  He's hurt!  What's wrong with you?!

GRANT.  She lost it!

\emph{Carol looks at Jeff, then Adele.  Carol indicates the gun.}

CAROL.  Why do you have that?

GRANT.  I've been trying to get her to act rationally, but---

ADELE.  Shut up!

GRANT.  ---she won't listen---

ADELE.  Shut up shut up SHUT UP!!

CAROL.  Adele, baby, did you---  What happened to your uncle Jeff?

ADELE.  I didn't do anything!

CAROL.  Explain this, then!

ADELE.  Ask Dad.

\emph{Carol goes to Jeff.  She kneels and cradles his head, a little too gingerly.  She looks like she's going to come unglued.}

CAROL.  \emph{(a prayer)} Help me \ldots help me \ldots help me.

\emph{Grant and Adele are watching her cradle Jeff's head.  She stands up.}

CAROL.  Give me the gun.

ADELE.  Why?

CAROL.  Cause I don't like having it pointed at me.

ADELE.  What are you gonna do?

CAROL.  I'm doing nothing.  Give it here.

\emph{Adele hands it over.  Carol holds the gun in both hands, looks, once, back and forth between Grant and Adele.  She snaps the neck and lets the bullets fall to the floor.}

\emph{EXT. WOODS - DAY}

\emph{Some distance from the cabin, but with the cabin still visible in the background, Grant hauls Jeff's body to a hole in the ground.  The body is wrapped with blankets and the tablecloth, tied with ropes.  Jeff's boots have been removed, and his socks, so that his bare feet are visible.  Grant hauls drags the body to the edge of the hole, sets down the end he's been dragging.  He kneels beside it and looks up into the sky, bright sun rays bearing down on him.  He closes his eyes.  Perhaps he's saying a little prayer.  Then returns to the task at hand: he rolls the body into the hole, then starts shoveling dirt over it.}

\section*{INT. CABIN: BEDROOM - DAY}

\emph{Adele beside her, Carol loads a backpack.  Carol has placed the rifle and all the bullets she can find in a pile on the nightstand.  She keeps herself between Adele and the weapon.}

ADELE.  We wasn't hunting no deer.

\emph{Carol busies herself with the chore of packing, trying not to have to think about what Adele is telling her.  Adele mimics Jeff's posture as it was when he shot Grant in the leg.}

ADELE.  He was this close, looking straight at him.

CAROL.  You're sure it wasn't an accident?

ADELE.  Mom.  No.

\emph{Adele gets a look of some recognition from her mother.}

CAROL.  Why?  Why would he do that?

\emph{Adele looks away.  She starts to tear up, those angry, scared, hurt tears.  When she looks back at her mother, her mom sees the rage.}

ADELE.  In the woods \ldots he made me \ldots

\section*{INT. CABIN: BEDROOM - DAY}

\emph{Adele lies on the bed beside a fully loaded and ready-to-go backpack.  She hears her mother's voice from outside:}

CAROL.  \emph{(O.S.)} Baby?  Baby let's go.

\emph{Adele gets up and presses her face to the screen window.  Grant comes out of the woods, sweaty, carrying the shovel.  Carol goes out to meet him, some distance from the log cabin.  They are talking, and Adele can't hear what they're saying.  She straps on her pack and exits the bedroom, specifcally not-looking at the bloodstained floor, then she goes outside.}

\section*{EXT. CABIN - DAY}

\emph{Adele goes over to them.  Carol and Grant's backpacks are zipped up and ready-to-go, leaning against the cabin steps.}

GRANT.  You really think it's safer this way.

CAROL.  It's the best I can come up with given the circumstances, so that's what we're gonna do.

GRANT.  Well \ldots I agree with you, partially.  I don't think she should have it.

CAROL.  And neither should you.

GRANT.  Neither should you, while we're at it.  You don't even know how to fire it.

CAROL.  The point of me having it is it won't get fired.

\emph{Grant shakes his head.}

CAROL.  Is everything \ldots taken care of?

GRANT.  Yes.

CAROL.  Then we're leaving.

\emph{Carol waits for him to go toward his pack.  She stays behind him, with Adele and Grant both in her field of vision at all times.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - DAY}

\emph{Loaded up with their backpacks, the family hikes back toward civilization, downhill, along the route they took from the car to the cabin.Grant goes first.  A safe distance behind him, Adele.  Behind Adele, close by, Carol, carrying the rifle.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS: MEANDERING BROOK - DAY}

\emph{Hiking back, they cross over the same meandering brook they crossed on their hike into the woods.  Grant goes first, then Adele, then Carol.  Halfway across the water, Grant bends and picks up a white flower blossom that has fallen from a tree above and is floating on the surface of the creek.  He smells it.}

GRANT.  It's funny how peaceful it is out here.  On the way out here I thought I could almost \ldots smell \ldots

\emph{Adele hesitates, arresting her step onto the next rock, and regards her father critically.}

GRANT.  Trouble?  Maybe not trouble.  Something, though.  Did you smell it?

\emph{He shakes his head and moves on.  He looks up into the treetops and inhales deeply.}

GRANT.  It is beautiful this time of year.

\section*{EXT. WOODS - DUSK}

\emph{As the sun sets, the family sets up camp.  Adele builds her own tent, the red two-person one, some distance from where Grant is building the larger blue tent.  Carol stands by, watching them both.  She's holding the rifle.  Grant is putting the finishing touches on the tent he's building: he throws the fly over it and ties it down.  He stands and goes to Adele.  She's struggling with her tent poles; it's hard to do by yourself.}

ADELE.  What are you looking at?

\emph{Grant makes a move to help.}

ADELE.  I've got it!

CAROL.  Just let her be.

GRANT.  Can't I help my daughter set up her tent?

CAROL.  She doesn't want your help.

\emph{Grant sighs heavily, turns, walks away.}

ADELE.  You could help me!

CAROL.  But then I wouldn't be able to keep an eye on things.

\emph{Carol, holding the rifle, sweating, moves away from Grant and Adele and sets the rifle on a rock.  She transfers a box of bullets from her jacket pocket to the side pocket of her pants.  Her pockets are already bulging with bullet casings.  She removes her jacket, sets it on the rock, and picks up the rifle.  Grant is watching her.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - NIGHT}

\emph{A propane lantern burns.  The tents are built.  The family sits around a propane stove.  Grant cooks sausage and eggs.}

GRANT.  Would you hand me that \ldots the salt.

\emph{The salt is within Grant's reach.  He nods in its direction.  No one gets it for him.  He is offended that they're making themselves so useless.}

GRANT.  Baby.  Help me out here.

\emph{Adele begrudgingly grabs the salt and holds it out for him.  Clearly, it would have been simpler if he had just grabbed it himself.}

GRANT.  Protein \ldots some good protein.

\emph{Grant shovels some eggs onto a plate.}

GRANT.  Sausage?

ADELE.  I'm not eating.

\emph{Carol hands the plate to Adele.  Adele looks at it skeptically, making no move to eat.}

GRANT.  It's not poison.

CAROL.  She don't have to eat if she don't want to.

\emph{Grant shovels some more out on another plate.  Carol sets this one in front of hersef.  She eats.  Grant serves himself last, blows on a forkful of eggs, and swallows his bite.  Some of the eggs get stuck in his beard.}

GRANT.  If you want, after this, I'll rustle up some of those biscuits.

\section*{EXT. WOODS - NIGHT}

\emph{Grant scrubs the dishes with a piece of steel wool by the light of the propane lantern.  Adele stands far back, watching, her flashlight shining in Grant's direction.  Carol sits on the rock with the gun.  Grant finishes washing, puts the dishes away, and goes to the blue tent.  His glances to the women are strained:}

GRANT.  You gonna sleep out here?

CAROL.  I'll be in in a minute.

GRANT.  \emph{(to Adele)} Sweet dreams, honey.

\emph{Adele switches off her flashlight.  Sound of her unzipping and zipping her tent.}

CAROL.  I gotta say something.  It's probably not what you're expecting.  I'm not sure what you're expecting, but \ldots well I mean there's a lot to talk about \ldots there has become \ldots a lot \ldots to talk about \ldots here \ldots lately.  Adele may have already told you this, but \ldots I \ldots me and Jeff \ldots

\emph{Grant starts to understand what she's saying.}

CAROL.  \ldots we \ldots

\emph{Carol shakes her head.}

CAROL.  \ldots did Adele tell you?

GRANT.  Did Adele tell me that you fucked my brother?

CAROL.  Right.

GRANT.  No.

CAROL.  Well \ldots I did.  We didn't plan it \ldots I mean \ldots

GRANT.  You mean recently?

\emph{Carol nods.}

GRANT.  That's nice.

\emph{Grant goes into the blue tent and zips it up only partway, leaving it partially open for Carol.  By the propane light, Carol takes a plastic toiletry case from her backpack and removes the toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, etc, from it.  She empties all her pockets of bullets, transferring them to the toiletry case.  She cracks the neck of the gun.  The chamber is empty.  She puts one bullet in, closes the gun.}

CAROL.  \emph{(a prayer)} Tell me what to do.

\emph{She sits for a long time.  Ultimately, she cracks the neck of the gun and removes the bullet.  She puts it in the toiletry case and closes the case.  The lantern burns beside her, the combustion of its gas making a loud ``hhohhhh'' sound.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - NIGHT}

\emph{No one is around.  The lantern, burning through the last of its fuel, spurts out.}

\section*{INT. PARENT'S BLUE TENT - NIGHT}

\emph{Carol lies awake beside a sleeping Grant, uneasy.}

CAROL.  \emph{(quietly, to see if he's awake)} Grant \ldots?

\emph{He doesn't respond.  Carol slips out of her sleeping bag and silently steps over her husband.  She unzips the tent in tiny movements, making almost no sound.  It's so dark all they can see of each other is silhouette.  She steps out of the tent.  Grant stirs, sees Carol leaving, sits up, frantically, half-awake, grabs her.}

GRANT.  What are you doing?

\emph{Carol shakes free of his grasp.}

CAROL.  Going to the bathroom.

\emph{She leaves, zips the tent up.  After a moment, Grant hears the tent door open, close.  In the darkness, feet stepping over him.  The sleeping bag beside him zipping closed.}

\section*{INT. PARENT'S BLUE TENT - NIGHT}

\emph{Later, Grant, lying awake, reaches over and pokes his wife.}

GRANT.  Honey.  Honey.

\emph{Grant peels himself out of his sleeping bag and escapes silently from the tent.  He leaves the zipper door open.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - NIGHT}

\emph{Grant silently opens his backpack and removes a roundish something.  He creeps through the woods toward the red tent.  He stealthily unzips the flap.}

\emph{INT. ADELE'S RED TENT - NIGHT}

\emph{He kneels over his daughter's sleeping body, snug in her sleeping bag.  He runs his hand over the form, lightly fondling its features.  The bag is pulled up partway over the girl's head.  He pulls it down a little.  He holds the roundish thing, which is a roll of duct tape, strategically with both hands.}

GRANT.  \emph{(whispering)} Happy birthday.

\emph{In a single movement, he extends a length of tape, attaches it to the girl's face, and wraps the roll once around her head.}

GRANT.  \emph{(a gruff whisper)} You finally get your present.

\emph{She wakes and tries to scream.  Holding her down, he shines a flashlight in her face and gets a nasty surprise: this isn't Adele, it Carol, and she's holding the hunting rifle in her arms.  She can't talk for the tape around her mouth, but her eyes say it all:  She swings the gun in his face.  He tries to grab it.}

\section*{INT. PARENT'S BLUE TENT - NIGHT}

\emph{Adele switches on a flashlight and gets out of her mom's sleeping bag, scrambling out of the tent.}

\section*{INT. ADELE'S RED TENT - NIGHT}

\emph{Carol and Grant struggle.  Carol screams as best she can through the tape.}

\section*{EXT. WOODS - NIGHT}

\emph{Adele runs toward the red tent with her flashlight.  A shot is fired.  The sound rings through the woods, stopping Adele in her tracks.  She stares at her tent.  Bodies thud over.  Adele is petrified.}

ADELE.  Mom??

\emph{The flap opens.  Carol rips the duct tape off her head and comes out of the tent.  She is covered in blood.  Adele drops the flashlight and runs to her mother.  Horrified, they embrace.  CUT TO BLACK.}

\section*{}

\emph{Two men roam the city.}

BRIAN.  Like that?

MARK.  Where?

BRIAN.  There.  That.  You didn't see that?

\emph{Mark shrugs.}

BRIAN.  That was beautiful.  Chinese.  That's all I want, is a Chinese girl like that, twenty-six, not too skinny, to come home with me every night and shag the fuck out of me.  But what's she gonna want?  Black dick.  Cholo dick.  She'll want to fuck around on me.  Girls can't be faithful.  They're all whores.

MARK.  So are we.

BRIAN.  Pfff \ldots

MARK.  Come on \ldots

BRIAN.  What?

MARK.  You wouldn't fuck around on her?

BRIAN.  Nope.

MARK.  You say that now.  You say that now cause you haven't gotten laid in \ldots?

BRIAN.  Six months?

MARK.  Not that long.

\emph{Brian shrugs.}

MARK.  Jesus.

BRIAN.  I wouldn't cheat on her.

MARK.  Not right at first.  But you would.

BRIAN.  My perfect little mail order bride?

MARK.  It wears off.

BRIAN.  Not this.

MARK.  It wears off.  Sex is like being hungry.  Even Ghandi, after like two double whoppers with cheese, is full.

BRIAN.  I wouldn't cheat on her.

MARK.  Sleep is the same way.

BRIAN.  Okay, you're right.  You are right.  I wouldn't \emph{cheat} on her though.  I'd break up with her first.

\emph{Mark looks doubtful.}

BRIAN.  I would.

\emph{Mark looks doubtful.}

BRIAN.  What?  I would.  She'd probably be cheating on me with you.  They do that.  They do that.  They'll fuck your best friend just because he seems sad.  They're great if you just got broken up with.  Some other bitch just pounced on your heart to spread her legs for a bun-length cholofrank, and here comes another one.  Like they do when they find a lost puppy like 'awww \ldots look \ldots he's so cute \ldots he must have been abandoned by his family'  Yes!  By \emph{you}, bitch!  At home, they abuse helpless puppies.  On the street, they stop to nurture anything that's wagging its tail.

MARK.  Then wag your tail.

BRIAN.  No.  I want it to be real.  I want her to love just me.

MARK.  Is that the way you'd love that little mail order bride back there?

BRIAN.  Is that the way you'd love her?

MARK.  I didn't see her.

BRIAN.  Want me to describe?

MARK.  I can imagine.

BRIAN.  Yeah?

MARK.  Knowing you?  Yeah.  Memoirs of a Geisha \ldots meets \ldots Sweet Valley Tampax.

BRIAN.  Knowing you?  It'd be more like Memoirs of a Geisha meets the Blair Witch Project.

MARK.  What does that mean?

BRIAN.  It means you're an axe murderer.

MARK.  That would be Memoirs of a Geisha meets Deliverance.

BRIAN.  Whatever.

MARK.  Anyway, with you it would be more like Memoirs of a Geisha meets Mary Kate and Ashley Olson.

BRIAN.  The Old Mary Kate and Ashley Olson.

MARK.  You mean the young Mary Kate and Ashley Olson.

BRIAN.  Right.  Pre-pubes.

MARK.  That's disgusting.

BRIAN.  I just want my little Chinese hottie.

MARK.  You still have that pocket pussy I got you?

BRIAN.  She looked like she went to NYU.

MARK.  She doesn't go to NYU.

BRIAN.  She \emph{looks} like she goes to NYU.  You know that look.  It's something to do with the baseball cap.

MARK.  Go jerk off.  I'm serious.  I'll wait.  You still have that pocket pussy I gave you?

\emph{Brian shrugs.}

MARK.  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't believe I'm doing this.  When they sign you up to be a best friend, they don't tell you about this part.  This is on page seventeen after all the insurance disclaimers and all the indemnification clauses---actually, no, I'm pretty sure this isn't even in the contract.  No, definitely.  Definitely no, this isn't in the contract.

\emph{Brian is paying no attention---he's staring into space, considering something.}

MARK.  There.

\emph{Mark holds out something---his own pocket pussy.  His friend pays no mind.  Brian comes back from his reverie.  Mark quickly conceals the toy.}

BRIAN.  It's the angle of the cap.  It's something about the angle at which the cap intersects the forehead.  Look at this guy, look at this guy.  Guy orders a chicken sandwich thinks he's hannibal lecter---`uh, yes, that all looks fine'---it's a plate of \emph{fries}!  Just cause you're wearing linen pants and silver-rimmed glasses doesn't mean \emph{shit}, buddy!  Go to Wendy's next time, get yer chicken sandwich.  Four ninety-nine.  Did you see that?  `Uh, yes, that all looks fine'.  Those fries cooked right for ya?  Yeah?  I'll deep-fry your face.  Girls go for guys like that, though.  Girls go for guys like that.  You know what I saw on the subway yesterday?

MARK.  What?

BRIAN.  Chinese guy.  Chinese girl, Chinese guy, cuddled up, like, teenager, rollercoaster, amusement park---

MARK.  Junior high field trip---

BRIAN.  Exactly.  She just got fingered for the first time.  He just fingered a girl for the first time.

MARK.  I remember that.

BRIAN.  I'm talking their first \emph{kiss} wasn't that long ago.

MARK.  Right.

BRIAN.  Either of em.

MARK.  Right.

BRIAN.  In junior high though.

MARK.  Okay.

BRIAN.  But this wasn't like that.

MARK.  What was this like?

BRIAN.  This was like \ldots he was like thirty, she was like fourteen---

MARK.  Damn---

BRIAN.  \emph{Maybe} sixteen---

MARK.  Hhholy cow---

BRIAN.  This guy was like \ldots thirty \ldots thirty-three.

MARK.  Oh.

BRIAN.  Nasty.

MARK.  Oh!

BRIAN.  Teeth problems.

MARK.  Oh no.

BRIAN.  Ugly face.  lines.  almost scars.  like he was in a war.

MARK.  Uh.

BRIAN.  And she's: \emph{all} into it.  I mean she's cooing, lying back, her eyes are closed, you just \emph{know}---

MARK.  No.

BRIAN.  You just know \ldots

MARK.  \emph{No}.

BRIAN.  I mean you just \emph{know}

MARK.  Oh no \ldots

BRIAN.  That this guy \ldots took this girl's virginity \ldots and she is in love with this guy like he's gonna be there for her the rest of her life, when in reality, you can tell, you can see, that this guy just played this little girl out of her virginity---

MARK.  She enjoyed it.

BRIAN.  For \emph{now}.

MARK.  No, I know \ldots

BRIAN.  But three months from now \ldots

MARK.  Oh, I know.

BRIAN.  She's gonna be---

MARK.  She's gonna be up his ass.

BRIAN.  She's gonna be up the ass of every man who ever \emph{breathed} for what he did or didn't do to her.

MARK.  But for now \ldots

BRIAN.  No, for now she's \ldots

MARK.  For now she's fine.

BRIAN.  For now she's still a sweet little girl.  For now she's still innocent.  For now she's still figuring things out and the world is still a big and exciting place where if you suggest to her that that man's passion for her runs shallower than the deepest, hottest ocean \ldots she will bite your finger off.

MARK.  But in three months.

BRIAN.  In three months \ldots

MARK.  Ha.

BRIAN.  In three months the two of you will sit down to coffee and a nice fat syringe of heroin and swap war stories from your youth.

MARK.  So she was hot then?

BRIAN.  As measured in Kelvin.

MARK.  And she was Asian.

BRIAN.  Chinese.

MARK.  What's up with that?

BRIAN.  It's something about the angle of the cap, I think.

MARK.  Seriously.

BRIAN.  Why do you like em?  Why do you like the brown-haired ones more than the light-head---?

MARK.  They've got a word for that, it's called `brunette'.

BRIAN.  Doesn't sound right.

MARK.  But that's the word though.

BRIAN.  I know.  Why do you like them?

MARK.  They remind me of my sister.

BRIAN.  That's disgusting.

MARK.  It is not and you know it.

BRIAN.  Is that really why you like them?

MARK.  Maybe.

BRIAN.  What a waste.

MARK.  What?

BRIAN.  That stupid Chinese bitch.

MARK.  The one who gave her virginity to the guy with scars on his face?

BRIAN.  Yes.

MARK.  Instead of you?

BRIAN.  Yes.

MARK.  Was he Chinese?

BRIAN.  Of course he's Chinese.  I already said he's Chinese.

MARK.  No you---

BRIAN.  Whatever.  He's chinese.  With scars on his face like he went to war.

MARK.  Hold up hold up hold up I think this chick is checking me out.

BRIAN.  She's not checking you out---

MARK.  Yes she is.  She's looking at my shirt.

BRIAN.  That's all chicks care about is what kind of job you have \ldots you want to know why guys drive ridiculous cars \ldots it's because chicks go for that type of retarded shit.  Guys don't want to make five hundred thousand dollars a year.  We just want to get laid.  But to get laid, these days, you've got to \emph{make} five hundred thousand dollars a year.  Chicks want you to buy them platinum, they want a house on venice beach, they want \emph{two} hundred pairs of shoes.

MARK.  You using the word 'chicks' is very antiquated.

BRIAN.  It's a matter of convenience.

MARK.  I think it's disrespectful.

BRIAN.  I know it is.  And you still don't get laid any more than I do.

MARK.  You know what you have to do if you want to get laid, right?

\emph{Brian shrugs.}

MARK.  Slap a ho.

\emph{Brian looks surprised.}

MARK.  That's right.  Slap a ho.

BRIAN.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I think Vin Diesel just stepped into the room.  I think---I think---

MARK.  Because that's what---

BRIAN.  Andrew Dice Clay just released thoracyclazine glutamate into the airstream and my best friend is---I think you just received an instantaneous complimentary brain transplant from an alien culture.

MARK.  No, because \ldots

BRIAN.  No, yeah \ldots

MARK.  Right?

BRIAN.  Right, yeah, no, I know, that's---

MARK.  Right, that's---

BRIAN.  It's the only---

MARK.  Because they---

BRIAN.  That's all they respond to.

MARK.  No, I know, it's---

BRIAN.  That's all they understand.

MARK.  They just \ldots

BRIAN.  They \ldots

MARK.  They don't \ldots

BRIAN.  Never \ldots

MARK.  Almost never \ldots

BRIAN.  Almost never do they \ldots

MARK.  Very rarely do they almost ever \ldots

BRIAN.  Rarely ever \ldots

MARK.  Very rarely \ldots

BRIAN.  Slap a ho?

\emph{Mark shrugs.}

BRIAN.  Slap a ho, then.

MARK.  She was Asian.

BRIAN.  Chinese.

MARK.  Chinese?

BRIAN.  Mandarin.

MARK.  Mandarin?

BRIAN.  Mandarin as the day you were born.  Mandarin as a baby's behind.

MARK.  Um \ldots

BRIAN.  This girl was as Mandarin as Michelle Yeoh.  And a young Michelle Yeoh, virgin Michelle Yeoh.  Michelle Yeoh, like \ldots six years old---

MARK.  Whoah, whoah---

BRIAN.  Laid out in green bamboo leaves with a little panda bear

MARK.  That's all I need!  six?

BRIAN.  icon in the bottom right corner that stands for \emph{freshness} \ldots

MARK.  Alright \ldots

BRIAN.  and \ldots

MARK.  That's fine \ldots

BRIAN.  and \ldots

MARK.  Reign em in \ldots bring back the horses.

BRIAN.  and \ldots Johnson's Baby Powder, baby wax, an unused pad of paper, clean napkins---like \ldots a beach \ldots with sand \ldots but still the icon of the panda bear---

MARK.  Whoah!  Whoah.  Stop.

\emph{Brian comes back to planet earth.}

MARK.  You had me at hello.

BRIAN.  How's Sarah?

MARK.  Awww, man, that girl gives me so much trouble.

\emph{Mark sees someone going by quickly on the sidewalk.}

MARK.  I didn't know Jewish people were allowed to roller skate.

\emph{Brian looks confused.}

MARK.  Doesn't it go against the, uh \ldots the \ldots

BRIAN.  No.

\emph{The Jewish man skates over to their table.  A woman skates over with him; she's on her phone.}

MAN.  Weren't you on E!  Entertainment Television?

MARK.  Yeah, I was.

BRIAN.  You were?

MAN.  I thought that was you.  He was saying some shit like `the kind of girl you want is one who seems nice on the outside, so you can take her home to mother, but really she's a whore'.

BRIAN.  You said that?

MARK.  I didn't say whore.

MAN.  Whatever, man.  That was cool.  How'd you get on that show anyway?

MARK.  I didn't even want to be on that show.  I was just walking down Hollywood Boulevard---

\emph{The Jewish man splits his attention between mark and his girlfriend.}

MAN.  Right---hold on, baby---

MARK.  This crew comes up, says `we're interviewing people about relationships'---

MAN.  Dude we gotta go---her sister is pregnant.

MARK.  Okay.

MAN.  You were awesome.

MARK.  Thanks.  Have a fantastic day.  Fuckhead.  You like how I just did that?

BRIAN.  What?

MARK.  `I was walking down Hollywood Boulevard'.

BRIAN.  Right \ldots?

MARK.  I just name-dropped \ldots a street.  Forget it.

BRIAN.  No, that's cool---

MARK.  Forget it---

BRIAN.  I think it's cool---

MARK.  No you don't.

\emph{Brian shrugs.}

MARK.  Anyway it's not.  So if you think it is, you're wrong.

BRIAN.  What's going on?

MARK.  I'm getting married.

BRIAN.  You are \ldots?  You are getting married.

MARK.  Actually, we already got married.  Yesterday we did this.

BRIAN.  Well, I'm happy for you.  Are you \ldots happy?

MARK.  I've been through so much with that girl, I mean I'm \emph{happy}, but it's not like seventh grade crush happy, can't contain myself happy.

BRIAN.  When were you gonna tell me?

MARK.  I hope you're not offended, I just wanted to give it some time \ldots to settle \ldots I wanted to tell you, I just wanted to make sure it was gonna stick \ldots this time \ldots brian I told anyone.

BRIAN.  Hey, that's okay.  I don't think I ever kept a secret like that from anyone.

MARK.  I didn't mean to keep a secret from \emph{you} \ldots

BRIAN.  It's alright \ldots

MARK.  It was just a secret from everyone.  It's no offense.

BRIAN.  No, it impresses me.  I just have to tell people stuff.  Especially my best friend.  It's impressive, that you can keep something secret like that.

MARK.  You should see my sister.  If you think I can keep a secret, you should see my sister.

BRIAN.  What?  She had a baby, she didn't tell anybody?

MARK.  No, close but---

BRIAN.  She's a lesbian---

MARK.  No, close---she's a doctor.  Whole time she was at school we all thought she was there for \emph{art history}.

BRIAN.  How do you know she didn't have a baby?

\emph{Mark shrugs.}

BRIAN.  So when did you two get back together?

MARK.  A few weeks.

BRIAN.  A few weeks?

MARK.  A month.

BRIAN.  You've been back together for a month and you haven't told your best friend?!

MARK.  I was scared to.  Not scared with you particularly, but scared in general.  I've been through so much with this girl I'm afraid to tell anybody about it.  It's embarrasing.  It's embarrasing what I've put up with from her.  It's embarrasing what I've done to her.  I'm scared for myself because I want it to work out.  I need this to work out this time or I really am done.  I've opened myself up for this girl.

BRIAN.  I know.

MARK.  Anyway I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

BRIAN.  It's okay.

MARK.  I wanted to, I just \ldots needed to deal with some aspects of this on my own before I let anyone back into the strange and wonderful world of me and \ldots

BRIAN.  Are you gonna get another place together?

MARK.  We already did.

BRIAN.  Of course.  that place on---

MARK.  Franklin.  Right.  So far it's been really nice.

BRIAN.  I'm happy for you, man.  You deserve it.

MARK.  Thank you.

BRIAN.  Smackin' that ass?

MARK.  You know it.

BRIAN.  Good times?

MARK.  Never had any problem in that department.  There's only one thing better than Asian women.

BRIAN.  What's that?

MARK.  Half-Asian women.

BRIAN.  What about that guy?  What was that guy's name?

MARK.  I don't want to say that guy's name.  She said she'd stop seeing that guy.

BRIAN.  Has or would.

MARK.  Has.  She deleted his number from her phone.

BRIAN.  You saw her do it?

MARK.  Why?

BRIAN.  How did they get back together last time?

MARK.  He called her.

\emph{Brian shrugs.}

MARK.  She said she's done with him.

BRIAN.  I hope so.

MARK.  I hope so, too, but what can I do?  I'm in love with the girl.  She said she's done.  She gives me such a hard time about that shit.

BRIAN.  \emph{She} gives \emph{you} a hard time?

MARK.  She thinks I'm too controlling.  I tried to tell her: I don't want to control you, I'm not trying to be in your business.  I'm not even necessarily demanding full monogamy.  She doesn't demand it from me.

BRIAN.  I don't see how you do that.

MARK.  Who knows?  Maybe someday when I'm fifty I'll meet some choker-wearing bleach blond little goth girl and wanna throw her against the wall.  Maybe she'll want to do the same.  She's always talking about her grad students: someday I'm gonna have research assistants, all this \ldots whatever, it's all a theory, now: she has no grad students and I have no bleach-blond choker girls, it's just me and her in a tiny apartment in little tokyo \ldots

BRIAN.  What if he calls her again?

\emph{Mark shrugs.}

BRIAN.  I'm not trying to say he's gonna.  I just don't want to see you hurt.

MARK.  I'm trying not to bring it up with her.  She flips out.  She says I don't even want her talking to other men.  All I'm saying is why do other men have to be an issue?  Like she comes home from the grocery store and starts telling me how some guy was flirting with her.

BRIAN.  Did she flirt back?

MARK.  I don't know.  Frankly, I don't care.  People flirt with people.  I hope she didn't flirt back.  I hope she didn't give him her \emph{number} or anything like that, but really, what can I do?  I mean honestly, does some checkout girl flirt with me at the grocery?  Yes she does.  Some bank teller?  Yes.  Some actress?  You know \emph{they} do more than flirt.  I mean, what, am I supposed to go out hunting down every man that through the course of a given day happens to flirt with my wife?  What I can't stand, though \ldots?  Why is it such a big deal to \emph{her}?  That's the problem.  Waitress flirts with me.  I have a five-second fantasy of how nice she would be to fuck.  Then I move on with my day.  By the time I get home, sincerely, I have no want or desire to mention it to my wife.  What does it mean that she's still talking to me about some guy in the supermarket at the end of the day?  Maybe for her it's more than a five-second fantasy.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm paranoid.

\emph{Brian looks silently at his friend.}

MARK.  I wake up the other night, she's on the phone with her ex-boyfriend---

BRIAN.  Which one?---

MARK.  The other one---

BRIAN.  Got it---

MARK.  And they're \emph{giggling} \ldots about something \ldots

BRIAN.  Is this the one who threatened to kill you?

MARK.  Well, that's the thing.

BRIAN.  So he \emph{did} say that?

MARK.  I'm \emph{paying} for this phone call, mind you.

BRIAN.  Unbelievable.

MARK.  I wasn't rude, I just took the phone out of her hand and said `hi, is this'---insert the name of asshole ex-boyfriend here---`yes, terribly sorry, but you're going to have to call the lady back on a landline.  My plan doesn't include enough minutes for all-night gigglefests with murderous ex-boyfriends.  Would you like the number?'

BRIAN.  You didn't give him the number.

MARK.  I can't make her not give it to him.

BRIAN.  He threatened to \emph{kill} you \ldots?

MARK.  I told her: if that motherfucker ever comes around with the intention to act on that threat, she better find a new gigglebuddy because I will stab him \emph{in the neck} with a \emph{bic pen}---right here---

\emph{Mark demonstrates, on brian, where the stabbing will occur.}

MARK.  Then I'll pull the pen \emph{out} of his neck and use it to write a check to his grandmother or whoever that says `\emph{fuck} you.  Sorry about your kid.  Please use the enclosed amount to adopt a chinese \emph{whore}.'  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'll stop.

BRIAN.  How can she even do that to you?

MARK.  They're friends.  They've known each other for a long time.

BRIAN.  Smackin' that ass, though?

MARK.  She can never decide.  One night she says she needs a break from sex, the next night she brings home a bottle of wine and wakes me up by sucking my dick.

BRIAN.  She says she needs a break from sex?

MARK.  It's like an academic thing, philosophical thing, like feminism \ldots but newer.

BRIAN.  And she brings home a bottle of wine.

MARK.  She didn't even want to drink it herself.  It was clear she was trying to get me drunk.  And then we fuck.

BRIAN.  Was it good?

MARK.  I always love drunk sex with her.

BRIAN.  Man.

MARK.  We used to post up in the kitchen doing shot after shot of firewater and then fuck.  She didn't let herself come, though.  The other night she didn't.  She only wanted me to.

BRIAN.  That's a power thing.  That's a bad sign.

MARK.  I know.

BRIAN.  I'm serious, dude, that's almost as bad as rape.

MARK.  Now \emph{I'm} feeling bad though.

\emph{Brian looks at his friend confused.}

MARK.  I went in her diary.

BRIAN.  \emph{What}?

MARK.  I was on her computer.  There's a folder \ldots called `journal'.

\emph{Brian shakes his head.}

MARK.  No, I know \ldots I never did anything like that before, but \ldots all this stuff: late night phone calls, and I found a receipt.

BRIAN.  A receipt for what?

MARK.  She won't talk about it.  It was for flowers.  I asked her about it and she just won't even talk about it.

BRIAN.  How can she do that?

MARK.  She threw it away and locked herself in the bathroom.  She won't look at me when I ask her about it.  It's just---the subject's closed---it doesn't exist, somehow.

BRIAN.  That's fucked up.

MARK.  I told her, too: I'm not looking to become Adolph Hitler here.  I don't want to control your life.  I'm not even asking who she has \emph{lunch} with---

BRIAN.  I would.

MARK.  All I'm trying to do is not get HI\emph{V}, you know?  This isn't nineteen fifty-\emph{seven}.  I'll never get to marry a \emph{virgin}.  No one's \emph{saving} themself for me.  I \emph{wish} girls played more hard to get \ldots then, when they were with me, maybe it would be a little harder for every other guy who walks into a supermarket to get under their skin.  You know?  I'll \emph{court} a girl.  I'll wait that out.  I don't need to be having sex on the first date.  I mean that's fine: look at me: I'm a second date guy.

\emph{Brian laughs.}

MARK.  I always fuck a girl on the second date.

BRIAN.  I guess I'm a first date guy.

MARK.  No you're a \emph{one} date guy.  I'll never understand that.  Like that makeup girl---

BRIAN.  Oooh, I'm telling you, you should have seen this girl's pigtails---

MARK.  Then why don't you go back for more?

\emph{Brian shrugs.}

MARK.  I mean, for me, even if it is just sex, I'm in it for like \ldots three months \ldots four months \ldots

BRIAN.  As you say: `to each their own'.

MARK.  To each their own.  And no judgement.  But what I want right now, is a girl with some loyalty.  I want a girl that goes to the grocery store and notices the \emph{peppers}.  Some thick skin.  And eyes for me.

BRIAN.  I hope that happens for you, man.

\emph{Mark chuckles.}

MARK.  I hope it's happening now.  But it's not.

BRIAN.  What do you mean?

MARK.  I mean that girl who notices the peppers, that's not my girl.

\emph{Brian looks confused.}

MARK.  You know she's fucking someone \emph{else}.  You \emph{know} she is.  She doesn't try to hide it.  I have to hide stuff but she doesn't have to hide anything.  If she and I are walking down Hollywood Boulevard and I glance at a half-naked \emph{mann}equin I'm gonna get reamed out about it for the next half a day.  Every third shop on Hollywood Boulevard is a panty shop.  Not looking at panties on Hollywood Boulevard is like not getting drunk at mardi gras.  But she's allowed to not even come home and I'm asking her where she was, not because I want to know if she fucked someone else---I mean, yeah, I want to know if she fucked someone else---but primarily I want to know where my little girl was.  I mean, just tell me: I worked late and slept over my girlfriend's.  She doesn't even call me.  I can't sleep.  Even among housemates, you know, people worry about each other.

BRIAN.  What night was this?

MARK.  This was two nights ago.

BRIAN.  And you're still staying married?

MARK.  I think \emph{she} thinks we're going to.  I just want her to talk to me.

BRIAN.  But she's talking to her ex-boyfriend.

MARK.  Right.

BRIAN.  Not the one she's fucking.

MARK.  Right.  The weird thing with me and her is: she \emph{does} want me around for some reason.  She's not breaking up with me.  She likes going shopping together.  She doesn't enjoy sex with me anymore, she doesn't tell me what she's really feeling, about life.  But she likes waking up next to me, and she likes when I clean.  It's like I'm her maid, or her pet.  I think she wants the company.

BRIAN.  Mark.

MARK.  What?

BRIAN.  I have something to tell you.  I'm fucking Sarah.

MARK.  Really.

\emph{Mark gathers his things and leaves.}

BRIAN.  Mark.

\emph{Mark lingers.}

BRIAN.  She doesn't talk to me, either.

\section*{Scene 1.  The deck of a ship}

LUCY.  Beautiful day.

PORTER.  Beautiful day.

LUCY.  I'm Lucy.

PORTER.  Porter.

LUCY.  Fall in love much, Porter?

PORTER.  What?

LUCY.  Simple question.

PORTER.  Define much.

LUCY.  No.

PORTER.  No?

LUCY.  I won't.  I will not.  I will not define much.

PORTER.  I fell in love once.  She was \ldots I've never been so affected by a person.

LUCY.  Me either \ldots never so affected as when I was in love.

PORTER.  And who did you love?

LUCY.  I loved a man.

PORTER.  Just one?

LUCY.  Just this one that I'm thinking of.

PORTER.  I loved a man once, too.

LUCY.  Did you?

PORTER.  Yes.

LUCY.  Just one?

PORTER.  Just one.

LUCY.  Well aren't you full of surprises.  Want a chip?

PORTER.  Thanks.

LUCY.  Have two.

PORTER.  Mmm.

LUCY.  Want an animal cracker?  I'm stocked.

PORTER.  I'm okay.

LUCY.  Really, you better have one.

PORTER.  You're right.  Really, I better.  Ooh, an elephant.

LUCY.  Bite the legs off first.

PORTER.  Usually I start with the head.

LUCY.  That reflects what type of lover you are.

PORTER.  No.

LUCY.  Yeah.  If you start with the heads you're more the bondage type.

PORTER.  And you start with the legs.

LUCY.  Yeah, I'm more the murder-suicide type.

PORTER.  That has nothing to do with sex.

LUCY.  Don't be so sure.

\emph{Lucy pulls out a miniature silver pistol, points it at Porter.}

PORTER.  You'd kill me already?

\emph{She points it at herself.}

LUCY.  Maybe me first.

PORTER.  No.

LUCY.  No.

\emph{She hands it to him, he points it out to the sea.}

PORTER.  It's beautiful.

LUCY.  It belongs to my husband.  He was just about to shoot himself with it.

PORTER.  I see.

LUCY.  I had to take it away from him before he did anything stupid.

\emph{Porter pretends to shoot the pistol, then gives it back.}

PORTER.  I'm not into bondage.

\emph{Lucy pockets the pistol.}

LUCY.  Bummer.

PORTER.  Well, not that into it.

LUCY.  I'm not that into murder-suicide, either, just on the weekends.

PORTER.  Today's Saturday.

LUCY.  I know.

PORTER.  Can I have another cracker?

LUCY.  Wha'd you get?

PORTER.  Hippo.

LUCY.  Give it to me.

PORTER.  Why?

LUCY.  They're my favorite.

PORTER.  Start with the head.

LUCY.  Why, you wanna tie me up?

PORTER.  Maybe.  Can I?

LUCY.  Ask me later.

PORTER.  It's later.

LUCY.  So ask.

PORTER.  Can I tie you up?

LUCY.  You're gonna be mad at me.

PORTER.  Why?

LUCY.  I'm married.

PORTER.  I'm furious.  Is he here?

LUCY.  See that guy right over there?

PORTER.  Mmm.

LUCY.  I've never met that guy in my life

PORTER.  Good.  Can I tie you up now?

LUCY.  No.  That is my husband.

PORTER.  He can help.

LUCY.  That really is my husband.

PORTER.  Excuse me, sir!

\emph{The guy comes over.}

JANEK.  Lovely, who's this?

LUCY.  What's your name again?

PORTER.  Porter.

JANEK.  Janek Henning.

PORTER.  Nice to meet you.

JANEK.  Nice to meet you.

LUCY.  We were just saying what a beautiful day it is today.

JANEK.  Yes.  It is today.  Beautiful day.

\section*{Scene 2.  Janek and Lucy in their cabin}

JANEK.  What was that guy's name again?

LUCY.  You know I'm bad with names.

JANEK.  Porter.

LUCY.  Yeah.

JANEK.  Let's have lunch with him tomorrow.

LUCY.  Why?

JANEK.  He seemed genial.

\emph{Lucy sneakily stuffs the silver pistol into a drawer.}

LUCY.  That's a horrible reason to have lunch with someone.

JANEK.  It's a fine reason, let's invite him.

LUCY.  I would if I knew where he was.

JANEK.  We'll see him around.  Don't drink anymore tonight ok?

LUCY.  This is a gin martini.

JANEK.  So?

LUCY.  Call it what it is.

JANEK.  It's a gin martini.

LUCY.  Right.

JANEK.  Don't drink it.

LUCY.  I will stop.  After this one.

JANEK.  Whatever.

LUCY.  Don't you like our drunk sex?

JANEK.  Are we going to have it?

LUCY.  Why not.

JANEK.  That's my girl.

LUCY.  Mm.

JANEK.  Such enthusiasm.

LUCY.  Blow me.

JANEK.  I'm going out.

LUCY.  I'm almost done.

JANEK.  You'll have your drink first, then we fuck.

LUCY.  I'm thirsty baby.

JANEK.  Back in a while.

LUCY.  No.  Where are you going?  I'm ready now.

JANEK.  Drink your drink.

LUCY.  No, stay.

JANEK.  I'll be back in twenty minutes.

LUCY.  I'll be asleep.

JANEK.  Okay, ten.

LUCY.  Are you mad?

\emph{He kisses her forehead.}

JANEK.  I'm not mad.

\section*{Scene 3.  Porter smokes his pipe on deck, Janek comes up}

PORTER.  You again.

JANEK.  She's a flirt, I apologize.

PORTER.  But you let her out of your sight.  Where is she now?

JANEK.  There's not much chance she's running around now.

PORTER.  Got her tied up in the room, a little bondage?

JANEK.  Nope.  I eat the legs first.

PORTER.  The whole animal cracker thing.

JANEK.  She says that all the time.

PORTER.  Piece of work.

JANEK.  She's okay.  Drinks too much.

PORTER.  How'd you meet?

JANEK.  On a ship.  Just kidding.

PORTER.  That's funny.

JANEK.  Have lunch with us tomorrow.

PORTER.  No.

JANEK.  Truce.  Seriously, I'm sorry if she hurt your feelings.

PORTER.  Don't be sorry for me.

JANEK.  Have lunch with us.

PORTER.  It might be awkward.

JANEK.  Tell me, what did she say to you?

PORTER.  Don't you think it might be awkward for you?

JANEK.  No.

PORTER.  Well, I'm telling you, it might be awkward for me.

JANEK.  She's fine.  We'll have a nice time, get to know us.

PORTER.  Why not.

JANEK.  That's the spirit.

PORTER.  Why not.

JANEK.  That's the spirit.  It'll be fun.  Do you drink?

PORTER.  On ships?  All the time.

JANEK.  You'll love my wife.

PORTER.  Alcoholic?

JANEK.  Hard core.

PORTER.  Perfect.

JANEK.  Beautiful night.

PORTER.  Beautiful.

\section*{Scene 4.  Janek comes into his and Lucy's cabin, Lucy is passed out}

JANEK.  How's my little gin martini?

\emph{Janek kisses his wife.  She turns.}

LUCY.  Mm.

\section*{Scene 5.  At lunch, at a table on the deck of the Zygos Taverna}

LUCY.  Animal cracker?

PORTER.  I'm fine with the steak.

JANEK.  Would you stop with the animal cracker thing?

LUCY.  Bring me another one of these things.

WAITER.  Sir?

JANEK.  Don't ask me, she's her own person.

WAITER.  Right away miss.  No offense intended.

LUCY.  It's fine, thank you.  No offense taken, I know I'm plastered

WAITER.  Very good.

LUCY.  Do you want an animal cracker?

WAITER.  No thank you miss.

LUCY.  You don't know what you're missing.

WAITER.  Thank you miss.  Be right back with your drink.

LUCY.  It's a gin martini.

JANEK.  Leave him alone.

PORTER.  Yes, torment me instead.

LUCY.  Now the two of you are going to bully up on me, I see.

JANEK.  It's the only way we can get an even match.

LUCY.  And what's with you telling him that I'm some kind of colossal flirt?

JANEK.  Aren't you?

LUCY.  Marriage is too hard, too long, too difficult for a human being.

JANEK.  Here here.  You married porter?

PORTER.  No.

JANEK.  Ever have been?

PORTER.  No.  Slept with a married woman once, but she wasn't married to me.

LUCY.  Nice.

PORTER.  Actually we slept together for five months.

LUCY.  That's horrible.

JANEK.  Did the guy ever find out?

PORTER.  No.  They had already split, but technically she was still married.

LUCY.  That doesn't count.

JANEK.  Sure it does.

LUCY.  It counts for something.  It just doesn't count for what you want it to.

PORTER.  How long have you two been married.

JANEK.  If you ask her she'll say it's been too long.

LUCY.  It has been too long.

JANEK.  In our case too long is measured in a span of six years.

LUCY.  See?

PORTER.  And you stayed faithful?

LUCY.  I did.

PORTER.  What about him?  No?

LUCY.  He says he did, but there was this one girl---

JANEK.  I never fucked her.

LUCY.  But you wanted to.

JANEK.  Of course I wanted to.  But I didn't.

LUCY.  So you say.

WAITER.  Gin martini.

LUCY.  Are you married?

WAITER.  No.

LUCY.  You should get married.

WAITER.  Anything else?

LUCY.  Yes.  I think it would help if you cut your hair.

JANEK.  Be nice, don't hurt his feelings.  Your hair is kindof long.

WAITER.  It is too long.

PORTER.  It's fine.  Don't listen to them.

LUCY.  I'll cut it for you later.  W e're in room twelve, come by anytime.

JANEK.  Do you have scissors?

LUCY.  Of course not, but this boat has to come with scissors.

WAITER.  Enjoy your gin martini.

JANEK.  Thank you.

WAITER.  I'll be back to check on you in a minute.

LUCY.  Bring the scissors.

PORTER.  Be careful, he might seriously bring scissors over here.

LUCY.  At which point I'll cut his hair.

PORTER.  Do you cut hair?

LUCY.  I'm looking to start.

JANEK.  You'll butcher him.

LUCY.  And he'll love every minute.

JANEK.  No doubt.  So, this married woman you fucked.

PORTER.  Kathryn.

JANEK.  Was she the only woman you ever cheated with, or on?

PORTER.  I cheated once \ldots on someone.

LUCY.  Was it nice?

PORTER.  It was horrible.

LUCY.  I bet it was nice.

PORTER.  It's the wrong order to do things in.

JANEK.  What happened with the girl you were with, the one you cheated on?

PORTER.  We broke up.  Not right away.  It killed her, really crushed her.

JANEK.  Anyone ever cheat on you?

PORTER.  Not that I know of.  Well.  One time.  Probably, yeah.  Probably.

JANEK.  That's harsh.

PORTER.  Wasn't good.  I'm not even sure it happened, but \ldots you kindof know.

LUCY.  It's better to tell the person.

JANEK.  It's better to tell.

PORTER.  Did you two really meet on a boat?

LUCY.  We really did.

PORTER.  Funny.

JANEK.  Bathroom.

\emph{Janek leaves.}

LUCY.  I wasn't just fucking with you yesterday.

PORTER.  What's that mean?

LUCY.  Like \ldots toying with you.

PORTER.  It's okay.  You are married though, so let's just keep some distance.

LUCY.  I don't want to make you uncomfortable.

PORTER.  Thank you.

LUCY.  But you did interest me.

PORTER.  In what way?

LUCY.  In a broad way.  Not just in one way.

PORTER.  Stop, though.

LUCY.  Why?

PORTER.  Stop with that.

LUCY.  I can't help what interests me.  And I don't hold back my feelings.

PORTER.  I don't hold back my feelings either.

LUCY.  What do you feel?

PORTER.  I like you.

LUCY.  In which ways?

PORTER.  All of them.

LUCY.  Meet me tonight.

PORTER.  Where?

LUCY.  Where we first met.  Our railing.

PORTER.  You won't tell him?

LUCY.  I won't.  Come at twelve.

PORTER.  Don't tell him.

LUCY.  I won't.

PORTER.  If we're going to have an affair I want it to be a proper secret.

LUCY.  Who said anything about an affair?

PORTER.  Well, if we're going to have an illicit meeting.

LUCY.  No.  It is an affair.

PORTER.  Are we really going to do this?

LUCY.  I don't know, just meet me.

\emph{Janek comes back.}

JANEK.  Did she start flirting with you as soon as I left?

PORTER.  Actually, she's gotten incredibly boring since yesterday.

LUCY.  It's the two of you who have gotten incredibly boring.

\emph{The waiter comes back with a pair of scissors.}

PORTER.  Oh my god.

JANEK.  He is fearless.

LUCY.  Have a seat.  Give me those.

WAITER.  Should I be scared?

JANEK.  Yes.  You should be very, very scared.

LUCY.  Actually, you should be terrified.

WAITER.  Actually, I am terrified.

LUCY.  Sit back.

WAITER.  Have you ever cut hair before?

LUCY.  If I say no is that a problem?

WAITER.  No.

LUCY.  Then no.

PORTER.  You're a brave man.

LUCY.  Have a drink.  We're all having one.

WAITER.  My boss won't let me drink while I'm working.

JANEK.  Nonsense, this is the Zygos Taverna!

PORTER.  Have a drink.

LUCY.  Here, sip this, it's a---

WAITER.  Gin martini, I know.

LUCY.  Of course you do.  Sorry, but I love to drive that point home.

JANEK.  Yes she does.

WAITER.  And how do you all know each other?

JANEK.  We're fencing buddies.

PORTER.  From way back.

LUCY.  Gimme my drink back.

WAITER.  God that's nasty.

LUCY.  How short do you want it, short or extra short?

\section*{Scene 6.  Nighttime, Porter stands at the railing, Janek comes up}

PORTER.  What's going on?

JANEK.  What are you doing out here?  Can't sleep?

PORTER.  Just thinking?

JANEK.  Have you seen Lucy?

PORTER.  No.  She's not with you?

JANEK.  I think she might be down in our room, not sure.

PORTER.  You haven't been down there?

JANEK.  Well, I was down there earlier.

PORTER.  Was she with you then?

JANEK.  She was.

PORTER.  Why are you asking me if I've seen her?

JANEK.  Cause I want to know if you've seen her.  No reason, why?

PORTER.  No reason.

JANEK.  So you can't sleep.

PORTER.  Sure can't.

JANEK.  Try getting totally fucking wasted, that's what my wife does.

PORTER.  Sounds fantastic.

JANEK.  Yeah.

PORTER.  Especially the drunk sex.

JANEK.  Did she tell you about that?

PORTER.  No.  I'm just referring to the general phenomenon.

JANEK.  Oh yeah.  Seriously, she didn't mention that to you?

PORTER.  No, she didn't.

JANEK.  Ok.  Sorry if I'm acting weird \ldots it's just \ldots .she walked out earlier.

PORTER.  Out of your room?

JANEK.  Out of the room.  And she didn't come back for a while, and I--

PORTER.  How long of a while?

JANEK.  Maybe fifteen minutes.  Maybe just ten, you didn't see her?

PORTER.  I really didn't.

JANEK.  I think you would tell me if you had.

PORTER.  What concerns you?

JANEK.  What concerns me about her leaving the room for fifteen minutes?

PORTER.  Yeah.

JANEK.  You're gonna think I'm crazy.

PORTER.  I doubt I'll think you're crazy.

JANEK.  Ok, I'll tell you.  What concerns me is \ldots that waiter.

PORTER.  Did you ask her where she went when she left your room?

JANEK.  No, I didn't want to seem paranoid.

PORTER.  Well, if it was just fifteen minutes, nothing could have happened.

JANEK.  Not unless they were really efficient.

PORTER.  I mean it could have happened, but that would have to be---

JANEK.  Really quick---

PORTER.  Too quick, unlikely---

JANEK.  Right, that's true.  It's just my mind.  Let me ask you something though.

PORTER.  Sure.

JANEK.  Did they seem like they were sitting kindof close?

PORTER.  Ehh, maybe.

JANEK.  Did she seem like she was too into it?

PORTER.  Nah.  I don't know.  Probably not.

JANEK.  It seemed like, just \ldots

PORTER.  Just \ldots

JANEK.  Just a haircut.

PORTER.  Just a haircut, yeah.  I think so.

JANEK.  Yeah, thanks.  It's probably nothing.  You don't think I'm paranoid.

PORTER.  Well, she gives you reason to be.

JANEK.  Yes she does.  Thanks for talking this out.  I'm tired, I'm going back.

PORTER.  Sleep well.

JANEK.  Thanks.  Say, you want to get a drink?

PORTER.  Is the bar open?

JANEK.  I'm pretty sure it's twenty-four hour.

PORTER.  I don't know.  It's very late.

JANEK.  What do you have to do in the morning?

PORTER.  True.

JANEK.  Sit, get a drink.  We'll talk about women.

PORTER.  Hmm.

JANEK.  We'll talk about sports.

PORTER.  Hmm.

JANEK.  We'll talk about technology, I don't care, come get a drink.

PORTER.  Okay.

JANEK.  Yeah?

PORTER.  Sure.

JANEK.  Good, good!

\emph{Janek puts his arm around Porter and leads him away.}

\section*{Scene 7.  Janek and Porter at the bar}

JANEK.  I'm standing next to this guy in the urinal, and he does one of these \ldots

PORTER.  No.

JANEK.  Yeah.  Like, there's a homeless fat man, naked, crouched on the toilet \ldots

PORTER.  Weirdest bathroom I ever went to---

JANEK.  The guy has shit himself.  This guy next to me is inching over---

PORTER.  Weirdest bathroom I ever went to was not in this country.

JANEK.  I wonder if women's bathrooms are this crazy.

PORTER.  They can't be.

JANEK.  Can you imagine two girls jerking each other off at the urinals?

PORTER.  If they had urinals.

JANEK.  You're not drunk enough to be talking to me, give him another.

PORTER.  No.

JANEK.  Give him another.

PORTER.  No, I'm drunk enough.  I'm drunk enough.

JANEK.  Also, why are women homeless people less insane than men?

PORTER.  I don't know.

JANEK.  You see women homeless people, but they're not \ldots they're not \ldots

PORTER.  They're not nearly as crazy.

JANEK.  No.

PORTER.  It's like the serial killer thing.

JANEK.  What is that?

PORTER.  How there aren't any women serial killers.

JANEK.  Oh yeah.  Well, there are, but---

PORTER.  There are?

JANEK.  There are women serial killers.  But not nearly as many as men.

PORTER.  It's just some hormone the addition of which makes one---

JANEK.  Right---

PORTER.  Makes one a serial killer.

JANEK.  My friend, I'm trashed.

PORTER.  As am I.

JANEK.  Can you walk me back to my room.

PORTER.  You need help to walk?

JANEK.  I think I might.

PORTER.  Ok.  Sure.

JANEK.  I'm sorry I was being paranoid about Lucy earlier.

PORTER.  It's ok.  No need to apologize.

JANEK.  Are we all paid up?

PORTER.  More than.

JANEK.  Good, let's go then.  Whoah!

PORTER.  Hold on.

JANEK.  Right, see.  I said I might need help with that.

PORTER.  Ok.

JANEK.  Such things are not to be attempted lightly.

PORTER.  No.

JANEK.  Always good to get shitfaced on a boat.

PORTER.  You're too heavy.

JANEK.  I can make it on my own!

PORTER.  Fine.

JANEK.  Would you shut the fuck up and listen to me for a moment?

PORTER.  Go ahead.

JANEK.  It's about my wife.  You know I love my wife, right?

PORTER.  Of course.

JANEK.  And I wouldn't want anything to happen \ldots that would mess that up.

PORTER.  Of course.

JANEK.  But \ldots there are exceptions.  Life is not a hard and fast rule, you know?

PORTER.  I know.

JANEK.  I know you know that.  You're a reasonable man, you impress me---

PORTER.  Stop.  Now you're just drunk talking.

JANEK.  No I'm not!  Not just---you do impress me.  You do.

PORTER.  Thanks.

JANEK.  I'm very impressed by you.

PORTER.  I have every respect for you as well.

JANEK.  Do you?

PORTER.  Yes.

JANEK.  Yes?

PORTER.  Yes.

JANEK.  Well, this is awkward, I know, but I guess there's only one way to do it.

\emph{Janek leans in and kisses Porter.  Porter pulls away.}

JANEK.  No?  Oh, I'm sorry.  How embarrasing, I'm a shit.

PORTER.  It's alright, it's alright, I'll walk you to your room.

JANEK.  No.  I can make it.

\section*{Scene 8.  Porter waits at the railing, Lucy comes up}

LUCY.  Beautiful night.

PORTER.  Strange night.

LUCY.  They go together.

PORTER.  How's your husband?

LUCY.  Oh, I don't want to talk about him.

PORTER.  I don't either, just tell me he's not about to walk up those stairs.

LUCY.  He's sufficiently destroyed, thanks to you.

PORTER.  Yeah?  Are we still having our affair?

LUCY.  Who said anything about an affair?

PORTER.  Are we still having our illicit meeting?

LUCY.  We could wait till tomorrow night if you'd prefer.

PORTER.  Could you wait, really?

LUCY.  No.  What happened between you two?

PORTER.  How do you know something happened?

LUCY.  I know my husband.

PORTER.  I doubt he'd want me to tell you.

LUCY.  That he's gay?  Yes, I know.

PORTER.  Why are you together?

LUCY.  Why do you think?

PORTER.  Did you know when you met him?

LUCY.  I wasn't sure.  Let's not talk about him now.

PORTER.  You brought him up.

LUCY.  I know, I'm sorry.  Let's not say anything.  Give me a smoke.

PORTER.  No more animal crackers.

LUCY.  I'm all out.

PORTER.  Did you see the waiter?

LUCY.  Is that what's worrying you?

PORTER.  It does, it does worry me, yes.

LUCY.  That was just a haircut.

PORTER.  Maybe this is just a smoke.

LUCY.  It is what it is.

PORTER.  I wonder, though, love---

LUCY.  Oh, it's love now?  What do you wonder?

PORTER.  If our ideas on what this is are similar.  Do you fuck him?

LUCY.  Janek?  Of course.

PORTER.  What's that like?

LUCY.  Dead.

PORTER.  Why do you stay then?

LUCY.  Do we have to talk about my husband?

PORTER.  I'm sorry.

LUCY.  I stay because he loves me.  There's a tenderness, we're familiar.

PORTER.  Like a brother and sister, though?

LUCY.  Don't judge me.

PORTER.  I'm not, I'm trying to understand.

LUCY.  How can you?  You don't love.

PORTER.  I don't?

LUCY.  How long have you been alone?

PORTER.  I know that love isn't lukewarm.

LUCY.  You're thinking of lust.

PORTER.  Oh.

LUCY.  Love is tepid on its sunniest day.

PORTER.  I think we're talking about two kinds of love.

LUCY.  This is the worst affair I've ever had.

PORTER.  It's just hard for me to get over---

LUCY.  Him?

PORTER.  Yes.

LUCY.  Get over it.  I need sex, from you.

PORTER.  So do I, from you.

LUCY.  Mm \ldots  What's wrong?

PORTER.  I'm sorry.

LUCY.  What is it?

PORTER.  I can't get it out of my mind.  Earlier tonight.  He kissed me.

LUCY.  Come downstairs.  Where's your key?  What's wrong?

PORTER.  I can't.

LUCY.  Ohh, bof, why should we suffer?

PORTER.  He's the one suffering.

LUCY.  You go be with him then.

PORTER.  And you.  Don't you suffer with him?

LUCY.  Yes.  Yes.  That's why we're doing this, to take my mind off it.

PORTER.  When's the last time you did it with him?

LUCY.  Oh, you suck.  Why do you want to know that?  Last night.

PORTER.  Did he tie you up?

LUCY.  No.  He didn't.

PORTER.  Good.

LUCY.  Yeah?

PORTER.  Like you've never been done before.

LUCY.  You're moody.

PORTER.  Sorry.

LUCY.  No.  I like that.

PORTER.  There's something you should know.

LUCY.  Tell me anything.

PORTER.  When I do something, I don't do it with half my heart.

LUCY.  Neither do I.

PORTER.  I'm not going to regret this.

LUCY.  Not if I do my part.

PORTER.  When I look back I'll be happy we connected this way.

LUCY.  I hope so.

PORTER.  It's not stolen.  It's not a trick.

LUCY.  It is stolen from someone.

PORTER.  Yes.

LUCY.  But not from us.

\emph{She leads him by the hand down the stairs, below deck.}

\section*{Scene 9.  Porter's room, total darkness}

LUCY.  Ow!

PORTER.  Too tight?

LUCY.  Maybe.  No, leave it.  Oh, you're evil.  Ahh!

PORTER.  Somebody's ready.

\emph{A knock at the door.}

JANEK.  Porter.  Porter, I can hear you awake in there, you're talking to yourself.

PORTER.  What is it?

JANEK.  I can't find my wife.

PORTER.  What do you want me to do?

JANEK.  Help me look for her.

PORTER.  It's a small boat, she'll come back.

\emph{Janek bangs on the door.}

JANEK.  Open up.  I'm sorry about earlier.  Can we get over that?

PORTER.  We're over it.

\emph{Janek bangs on the door again.}

PORTER.  Stop that.  People are trying to sleep, including me.

JANEK.  Come help me look.

PORTER.  Go back to bed.

JANEK.  She's with that waiter.

PORTER.  She is not with the waiter.

JANEK.  Help me look.

PORTER.  Go to bed.

\emph{Janek knocks on the door again.}

PORTER.  I'm serious, get away from my door.  No offense, but I need to sleep.

JANEK.  Fine, fine.  I'm going, but if she's dead it's your fault.

PORTER.  You're drunk.  Get some sleep.

JANEK.  Or if I find she's sleeping with that waiter.

PORTER.  You're safe on that front, my friend.

\emph{Janek comes back to the door.}

JANEK.  Is she in there!?

PORTER.  Step away from my door, Janek.

JANEK.  She better not be in there.

PORTER.  Good night, good night.

\emph{Janek goes.}

PORTER.  Can you stay?

LUCY.  Half an hour.

\section*{Scene 10.  It's the afternoon; Porter, Lucy, and Janek sit at a table}

\emph{They pick at food.  No one says anything for a long time.  The waiter comes up.  His hair is uneven and massively shorter than before.  He goes to take Lucy's plate away, but she stops him.}

LUCY.  It's alright.

WAITER.  No, it's fine.  I'll get it.

LUCY.  I'm sorry.

WAITER.  Don't worry about it, it's no big deal.

LUCY.  I can try to fix it.

WAITER.  No.

JANEK.  I'm sure he's been more than compensated.

LUCY.  We're fine.  Just ignore him.

JANEK.  More than compensated.

LUCY.  You don't know what you're talking about.

JANEK.  Did you tell her what happened?  Did you?

LUCY.  I already know, you fag.

PORTER.  I didn't tell her anything.

LUCY.  You practically told me, when you came in.

JANEK.  I'm sorry.

LUCY.  What do I care?

JANEK.  I'm an evil human being.

PORTER.  No you're not.  Don't call him a fag, be nice.

LUCY.  Spoken like a true fag, now there's two of you.

JANEK.  Just don't go behind my back, porter, if we ever get married.

PORTER.  I'm probably never going to get married.

LUCY.  That's a horrible thing to say.

PORTER.  It's true.

LUCY.  Well, that's a horrible way to be.

JANEK.  No, he's right.  What's the point of it, these days?

LUCY.  I love you, you know that?

JANEK.  But what does that love mean.  What does it translate into?

LUCY.  Love isn't about that you do.  It's about how you feel.

JANEK.  The two should go together.

LUCY.  You can speak.

PORTER.  Please, let's have a little peace.  A little peace for breakfast.

\emph{They sit in silence.  Waiter comes back, approaches gingerly.  When he picks up Janek's plate, Janek grabs the waiter's collar.}

JANEK.  Did you fuck my wife?

Dishes fall.  Porter and Lucy both jump up.

LUCY.  Leave him alone.

PORTER.  Lay off!

JANEK.  Did you fuck my wife?

LUCY.  He didn't do anything.

PORTER.  Let go of him.

JANEK.  Just tell me.  It's okay, I'm a fag anyway.

LUCY.  Drop it with that.

PORTER.  I'm very sorry.

JANEK.  If you fucked my wife, I won't be mad.  I promise, I won't be mad.

PORTER.  Just leave us alone.  I'm sorry.

\emph{Janek pulls out the silver mini-pistol and points it at the waiter.}

JANEK.  Please offer me the respect of telling me.

LUCY.  I didn't sleep with him.

JANEK.  I'd like to hear it from him.

PORTER.  Janek, relax.

JANEK.  Please stay out of this.  Just tell me, kid.

WAITER.  I didn't do anything.

LUCY.  I gave him a bad haircut, is all, baby, give me that.

JANEK.  That is a pretty bad haircut.

LUCY.  No, it's awful.  Give me that.  You're just upset.

JANEK.  But do I have a reason to be?

LUCY.  What do you mean?

JANEK.  Did you get with this kid?

LUCY.  No.

JANEK.  Where were you last night?

LUCY.  Nowhere.

JANEK.  You were somewhere.  Where were you?

LUCY.  I wasn't with him.

\emph{Janek steps to the waiter, the gun muzzle touches the kid's head.}

JANEK.  Was my wife with you last night?

\emph{The waiter shakes his head.}

JANEK.  Say it.

WAITER.  No.

JANEK.  Then where the fuck were you?!

\emph{Porter puts his hand on Janek's gun arm.}

PORTER.  Janek.

JANEK.  What?

PORTER.  She was with me.

\emph{Janek takes this in, lowers the gun, steps back from the situation.}

JANEK.  I have never cheated on you.

LUCY.  We shoulda never been together in the first place.

JANEK.  You're only ever toe-deep in love.

LUCY.  Baby, stop being dramatic.

JANEK.  Porter.

PORTER.  I'm sorry.

JANEK.  Want an animal cracker?

\emph{Janek steps to the railing, points the gun at himself, shoots.  Lights out.}

\section*{Scene 11.  In Lucy and Janek's cabin}

\emph{Janek is in bed, his shoulder bandaged.}

JANEK.  Ow!

LUCY.  You're lucky.

JANEK.  I'm just stupid, is all I am.

LUCY.  What are you gonna do, when we dock?

JANEK.  What do you mean?  You're serious.

LUCY.  We can't go on like this.

JANEK.  I'm too used to you, I can't handle myself without you.

LUCY.  I know, that's becoming a problem for me.

JANEK.  Then stay, we'll get a little place.  We'll get two places---

LUCY.  I don't want two places.

JANEK.  I just thought you might be more comfortable---

LUCY.  But what are we then?

JANEK.  There are different types of couples.

LUCY.  I can't do two places.

JANEK.  If the existing models don't work, try something new.

LUCY.  We tried.

JANEK.  Try again.

LUCY.  I'm tired, I can't.

JANEK.  Don't go.

LUCY.  I need some air.

JANEK.  Don't see him now.  We need to work things out, between us.

LUCY.  We're done.

JANEK.  Help me.

LUCY.  You're fine.  I can't always be standing between you and a gun.

JANEK.  You won't be.

LUCY.  I'm not so sure.

JANEK.  Don't go.

LUCY.  I'll be back.

JANEK.  Don't see him, I can't stand thinking about it.

LUCY.  Maybe I'm not going to see him.

JANEK.  Are you or aren't you?

LUCY.  None of your business.

JANEK.  I'm dying and you're having an affair.

LUCY.  Did you kiss Porter last night?

JANEK.  Yes.

LUCY.  While he was drunk?

JANEK.  We were both drunk.

LUCY.  He's not gay.

JANEK.  Now we know for sure.

LUCY.  Not funny.

JANEK.  Stay.

LUCY.  No.

JANEK.  Stay.

LUCY.  No.

\section*{Scene 12.  In Lucy and Janek's cabin}

\emph{Lucy comes back.}

JANEK.  Did you fuck him?

LUCY.  Jesus.

JANEK.  How was it?

LUCY.  There are other things to do on this ship, you know.

JANEK.  Like what?

LUCY.  Shoot yourself in the shoulder.

JANEK.  Did you do that?  I think you heal faster than me.

LUCY.  Cause I'm a girl.

JANEK.  Stay with me.

LUCY.  I'm with you.

JANEK.  When we dock.

\emph{She turns from him.}

JANEK.  If you don't, what are you gonna do?

LUCY.  I'll manage.

JANEK.  I know you'll manage \ldots but \ldots why make things harder on yourself?

LUCY.  How's your shoulder?

JANEK.  We can get two places, you can be with whoever you want, I won't pry.

LUCY.  Then what are you and I?

JANEK.  It's not always in a definition.

LUCY.  I don't want two places.

JANEK.  I won't even have to come over, you can get a place I don't know about.

LUCY.  Stop.

JANEK.  Anywhere you want, just to know you're in the same city \ldots

LUCY.  What if you get mad at me?

JANEK.  When have I ever gotten mad at you---

LUCY.  Ooohhh---

JANEK.  Recently.

LUCY.  You're mad at me all the time.

She is leaving.

JANEK.  Back for more, huh?  He must really have you wound up tight.

LUCY.  Save your strength.

JANEK.  I'm feeling much better, maybe we can make this a threesome.

LUCY.  I'll ask.

JANEK.  Please don't go.

She closes the door, leaving Janek alone in the cabin.


\section*{Scene 13.  In Lucy and Janek's cabin}

\emph{Janek is sleeping.  Lucy comes in.}

LUCY.  Do you need anything?

JANEK.  Get me out of this room.

LUCY.  Let's get some dinner.

JANEK.  You came to check on me, you do love me.

LUCY.  Of course I love you.

JANEK.  I love you, too.

LUCY.  Okay.

JANEK.  Listen, I would never want to push things \ldots

LUCY.  Then don't.

JANEK.  What's for dinner?

LUCY.  That's my boy.

JANEK.  Ahh!

LUCY.  Sorry.

JANEK.  What have you been doing?  Not prying, not prying, how's the weather?

LUCY.  Crappy.  Raining.

JANEK.  Really?

LUCY.  Actually, it's beautiful.

JANEK.  Good.  Let's eat outside.

LUCY.  Wherever you like.

JANEK.  You're in a pleasant mood.

LUCY.  Don't start.

JANEK.  No, it's fine, invite him.  I don't care.  Even invite that waiter.

LUCY.  We might have to get a different waiter.

JANEK.  You don't think he'll hold that against me.

LUCY.  I think he is holding it against you.

JANEK.  You talked to him.

LUCY.  I listened.

JANEK.  He had a lot to say?

LUCY.  Very colorfully.  I told him you were manic-depressive.

JANEK.  Did that help?

LUCY.  Didn't seem to care.

JANEK.  Tell him I'll tip a lot.

LUCY.  He asked to work in the kitchen tonight.

JANEK.  He's going to poison me.

LUCY.  No.  Porter's going to poison you.

JANEK.  Why?

LUCY.  So he can be with me.

JANEK.  Fuck a man's wife and then you want to poison him.  Doesn't seem right.

LUCY.  Is this okay?

JANEK.  Yeah.  Lucy.

LUCY.  Yeah.

JANEK.  When we de-board---

LUCY.  Answer's still the same.

JANEK.  Think about it.

LUCY.  I've been thinking about it for a long time.

JANEK.  Is Porter gonna be there, at dinner?

LUCY.  Do you want him to be?

JANEK.  Why not.

LUCY.  I'll ask him.

JANEK.  Thanks.

\section*{Scene 14.  Outside, evening, at a table}

\emph{This evening, Janek and Porter are drinking, and Lucy is not.}

PORTER.  Are you really manic-depressive?

JANEK.  Term's bipolar.

PORTER.  Well are you?

JANEK.  Nah, I just like guns.

PORTER.  Where is our little guy tonight?

JANEK.  Lucy says he asked to work in the back.

PORTER.  Too bad, that was a lot of fun yesterday.

JANEK.  My shoulder stings like a bitch though.

PORTER.  Sure do love your wife's pussy though.

\emph{Porter raises his glass to toast Janek.  Janek matches him.  Lucy punches porter in the arm.}

LUCY.  Stop it you all, Jesus, you stuck a gun in that kid's face.

JANEK.  Probably get arrested when we come ashore.

LUCY.  Probably.

JANEK.  Worth every penny.

LUCY.  That doesn't make any sense.

JANEK.  But it doesn't matter \ldots we're aboard the Zygos Taverna.

LUCY.  You know they really are probably going to arrest you when you get back.

JANEK.  Only if I survive.

\emph{Lucy takes Porter's drink from him.}

LUCY.  Lay off the vodka, Jesus.

PORTER.  Hey!

JANEK.  Give it back.

LUCY.  Since when are you two asshole buddies?

JANEK.  Very clever.

LUCY.  So to speak.

JANEK.  There's my girl.  Life doesn't always have to be a trial.

LUCY.  This coming from you.

\emph{The waiter comes out.}

WAITER.  How is everything?

PORTER.  Want a haircut?

LUCY.  Leave him alone.

JANEK.  I thought you were working the back tonight.

WAITER.  We're short-staffed, believe me, I'd prefer to wash dishes tonight.

PORTER.  Don't be like that.

JANEK.  No harm was meant.

LUCY.  That was my first time cutting hair.

WAITER.  It wasn't the cutting of hair that was a problem, miss.

JANEK.  Look, I said I was sorry.

WAITER.  Given that you're clearly crazy, I accept your apology.

JANEK.  Term's bipolar.

WAITER.  Whatever.  Would you all like another round of vodkas?

LUCY.  Nothing for me.

WAITER.  Or would you rather a dish of crack cocaine?

JANEK.  The vodkas are fine.

PORTER.  I'll have the crack though.

WAITER.  Silver tin okay?

PORTER.  Bring a straw.

WAITER.  Very good sir.

\emph{The waiter leaves.}

PORTER.  When he comes back offer to shave his head.

\emph{Janek and porter fake-fight, but it's on that cracking edge.}

JANEK.  Did you fuck my wife!

PORTER.  Yes!

JANEK.  Did you fuck my wife?!!

PORTER.  Yes!

JANEK.  I know you did you shit.  You're lucky I didn't shoot you yesterday.

PORTER.  You're lucky I didn't shoot you in self defense, you faggot.

LUCY.  Boys, boys, I can't take this!  Stop, please.  Please, my head hurts.

JANEK.  Sorry, dear.  Have porter here give you a backrub, it'll help.

LUCY.  How convenient it is for this all to come to a head right now.

JANEK.  You couldn't be giving head to a better man than my friend Porter.

LUCY.  Please.  And you make him stop, this stopped being cute an hour ago.

JANEK.  But what else do people talk about in an age with no integrity?

PORTER.  Unfortunately I'm woven into precisely the things I rail against.

JANEK.  The thing to do is find some moderation, some happiness inbetween \ldots

PORTER.  It's true you can't navigate at all with too rigid a stance.

Waiter comes back.

WAITER.  Vodkas.  I brought one for you just in case, miss.

LUCY.  On second thought, thank you.

\emph{She downs it.}

LUCY.  Thank you sir may I please have another.

WAITER.  Right away, and for you, and you.

\emph{He passes out the other vodkas.  Lucy stands and goes to the railing.}

LUCY.  Of all the oceans of the world, we find ourselves in this one.

\emph{Janek starts to grimace, to choke.}

PORTER.  You okay?

LUCY.  Baby?

PORTER.  Took it in the wrong pipe?

JANEK.  So to speak.

PORTER.  Are you choking?

\emph{Janek shakes his head.}

LUCY.  What's wrong baby?  He's choking!

PORTER.  He wouldn't be able to talk if he was choking.  Just breathe out.

JANEK.  There's something in the drink.

LUCY.  There's not something in the drink, you just breathed it in the wrong way.

JANEK.  It's \ldots the drink.

PORTER.  Is there something in this drink?

WAITER.  There's nothing in the drink, he's choking.

LUCY.  Baby!

PORTER.  Hit him!

LUCY.  You do it!

\emph{Janek seems to be expiring.}

LUCY.  Jesus!  What is in the drink?

WAITER.  It's just vodka!

\emph{The waiter starts giving Janek the Heimlich.}

JANEK.  Get off me.  Get off me.

\emph{Janek brushes himself off, stands up.}

JANEK.  I just wanted to see if you assholes would sit there and let me die.

\emph{Everyone is shocked.}

JANEK.  Looks like I was wrong.

\emph{Janek walks off, down the stairs, below deck.}

\section*{Scene 15.  Janek and Lucy's cabin}

\emph{He's already there.  She comes in and starts packing.}

LUCY.  You're evil.

JANEK.  Not really, baby, I'm just a scientist.

LUCY.  That makes it all better.  We were scared.

JANEK.  You're not coming back to live with me?

LUCY.  I am not.

JANEK.  Well, consider your account dead.

LUCY.  Bummer.

JANEK.  You don't care?

LUCY.  I don't.

JANEK.  Yes you do.

LUCY.  I'll manage.  I'm getting another room.

JANEK.  Surely you can sleep with me for one more night.

LUCY.  No.

JANEK.  Then we de-board, then you and Porter run off together.

LUCY.  I'm not running off.  I'm not even sure I'll be with Porter.

JANEK.  Just make sure he's not gay before you marry him.

LUCY.  Don't worry, I made double sure last night.

JANEK.  Oh yeah?  What does he do that I don't?

LUCY.  New subject.

JANEK.  What?

LUCY.  The account.

JANEK.  What about it?

LUCY.  Will you leave what's in there in there?

JANEK.  This is you not-caring about the account.

LUCY.  I don't care about you keeping it going, that wouldn't be fair.

JANEK.  This is you \ldots not-caring about the account.

LUCY.  A simple question.  Will you leave what's in there in there?

JANEK.  Or what?  You're forced to go whoring with Porter?

\emph{Lucy slaps Janek.}

JANEK.  Sucks, doesn't it?  Without me your options change.

\emph{She goes to him, slowly, gently, and kisses his forehead.}

LUCY.  I did love you.

\emph{She leaves the room.}

JANEK.  Don't go.

\emph{She closes the door.}

\section*{Scene 16.  Misty night, Porter and Lucy on deck}

PORTER.  Tomorrow, I have two train tickets heading down the coast.

LUCY.  Is one of them for me?

PORTER.  If you want for it to be.  Do you want it to be?

LUCY.  Maybe.

PORTER.  Just maybe.

LUCY.  Isn't maybe good enough sometimes?

PORTER.  It depends on how closely you're involved with the person who says it.

LUCY.  I know, I'm sorry, but it is just maybe.

PORTER.  What about tonight, is tonight just maybe also?

LUCY.  Tonight is most definitely definitely.

PORTER.  Yeah?

LUCY.  Definitely most definitely.

PORTER.  Our last night aboard the Zygos Taverna \ldots maybe not our last night \ldots

LUCY.  It's not our last night.  It just might be our last night for a while.

PORTER.  Live with me.

LUCY.  It's too soon.

PORTER.  You'd like my place.

LUCY.  What would I like about it?

PORTER.  You'd like the rocking chairs on the front porch \ldots cracking paint \ldots

LUCY.  Mm.

PORTER.  You'd like the beach.  There's a broken fence the dogs trample over.

LUCY.  You have dogs!?

PORTER.  I love my dogs.

LUCY.  What kinds?

PORTER.  A scottish terrier and a golden retriever.

LUCY.  I love golden retrievers.

PORTER.  So do I.

LUCY.  That must make the other one jealous.

PORTER.  I don't let on.

LUCY.  What are their sexes?

PORTER.  Both girls.

LUCY.  You like girls better.

PORTER.  I do.

LUCY.  They like you too, don't they?

PORTER.  They have, some.  From time to time some of them have liked me.

LUCY.  Will you miss me?

PORTER.  Not if you come with me.

LUCY.  I'm a bad partner.

PORTER.  The past does not predict the future.

LUCY.  I don't mean him, I mean, in general.

PORTER.  I could try to argue with you but I think I won't.

LUCY.  Thank you.

PORTER.  Animal cracker?

LUCY.  Where did those come from?

PORTER.  I stole them from your room.

LUCY.  You did not!

PORTER.  They have them in the kitchen, believe it or not.

LUCY.  Magic!  Thank you!

PORTER.  What should I eat first?

LUCY.  Eat the whole thing whole, tonight, I'd say, definitely.

PORTER.  What does that mean?

LUCY.  It means life is short.

PORTER.  So eat the whole thing now in case there's no chance to eat the rest?

LUCY.  No.  You're the animal.

PORTER.  Oh.

\emph{They both swallow an animal whole.}

LUCY.  I remember my first boyfriend in high school.

PORTER.  Don't tell me about your ex-boyfriends.

LUCY.  No, you'll like this.  I remember my very first time.

PORTER.  Where did you do it?

LUCY.  That's not the point.  We did it in my parent's basement.

PORTER.  Congratulations.  I wish I had been there.

LUCY.  That's not the point.  The point is \ldots in all that time \ldots

PORTER.  Just kiss me.

LUCY.  In all that time I've never been with someone I liked as much as you.

PORTER.  Now you're lying.

LUCY.  No.

PORTER.  Let's go.

LUCY.  Okay.

PORTER.  Let's go right now.

LUCY.  We're going.

PORTER.  Let's hurry.

LUCY.  Ooh, I like this.  You gonna tie me up?

PORTER.  No.

LUCY.  Spank me?

PORTER.  No.

LUCY.  What then?

PORTER.  I'm gonna make love to you.

\emph{She puts her finger over his lips--shhh.}

LUCY.  I'll be right back.

\emph{Lucy goes.  Porter speaks to the audience.}

PORTER.  She never did come back.

\section*{Scene 17.  Sound of Lucy screaming}

\emph{Lucy and Janek's cabin.  Janek is slumped on the floor.  Lucy kneels over him.  Porter comes in.}

PORTER.  What is it?

LUCY.  He's not breathing!

PORTER.  For how long?

LUCY.  I don't know, I just came in and he was like this!

\emph{Porter feels Janek's neck.  His hand retracts from the cold.  The waiter comes in.}

LUCY.  Try to get help!!

\emph{Porter embraces her.}

PORTER.  It's too late.

\section*{Scene 18.  Janek and Lucy's cabin}

LUCY.  It's the first thing any normal person would think.

PORTER.  Absolutely not.

LUCY.  What about you.

WAITER.  How could I?

LUCY.  I don't know, I don't know, I'm just asking, there could be reasons.

WAITER.  I mean, just, logistically--

LUCY.  You're sticking by your answer?

PORTER.  Did not, did not, have anything to do with this.

LUCY.  Okay, and that's possible, it's even likely \ldots that crazy bastard \ldots but---

PORTER.  I would tell you.

LUCY.  I think you might.  And if you did, I don't want to hear about it.

PORTER.  But---

LUCY.  I'm just saying if.  After this moment it's a closed deal.  From all sides.

WAITER.  Did you do it?

LUCY.  No.  I could have, but I didn't.

PORTER.  He probably did it to himself.

LUCY.  I'm sure he probably did \ldots but things happen, aboard ships \ldots

PORTER.  What did he do it with?

WAITER.  He could have just swallowed gasoline.

LUCY.  Please.

PORTER.  Gasoline?  You think he swallowed some of the ship's gasoline?

WAITER.  It's possible.

LUCY.  Please, please, who cares.  I don't want to think about the specifics.

WAITER.  I'm sorry.

LUCY.  Anyway it doesn't matter, seeing that he shot himself yesterday.

PORTER.  In the chest.

WAITER.  At point blank.

PORTER.  But he missed.

LUCY.  But he didn't mean to miss.  Look we're not gonna figure this out.

PORTER.  He killed himself, there, it's figured out.

LUCY.  I agree.

WAITER.  Why do I feel like we're congress voting to pass a bill?

LUCY.  It's not congress.

WAITER.  They're going to do an autopsy.

LUCY.  No doubt, and they're going to find a man who shot himself in the chest.

PORTER.  And has had too much to drink, and who swallowed the ship's gasoline.

WAITER.  Really?

PORTER.  I'm just saying.  Maybe he's had something to drink other than vodka.

WAITER.  Has he?

PORTER.  Not that I know.  But if he has, they'll find it.

LUCY.  Whatever the details, this is a man who clearly wanted to commit suicide.

PORTER.  And who probably now has.

LUCY.  Right.  Anything else is beyond us.

WAITER.  Ok.

\emph{The guys trade a glance.}

LUCY.  Can I be alone with my husband now?

\emph{The guys leave.  Porter closes the door.}

LUCY.  I'm sorry baby, it's better this way.

\section*{Scene 19.  The ship is at port}

\emph{The waiter comes upstairs with his bag.}

PORTER.  Have plans?

WAITER.  Nothing special.

PORTER.  Me neither.  Seen Lucy?

WAITER.  She might be downstairs or something.

PORTER.  Strange girl.

WAITER.  Seems to be.

PORTER.  Coming back to this ship soon?

WAITER.  Nah, this ship is bad luck.

PORTER.  Think so?

WAITER.  Had a gun held to my face.

PORTER.  That's right.  Least the guy didn't pull the trigger.

WAITER.  True.  So you're an optimist then?

PORTER.  That's right.  Smoke?

WAITER.  Nah, better get my bag.

PORTER.  Tsn't that your bag right here?

WAITER.  My other one.  Have a nice trip.

PORTER.  Yeah, you too.

\emph{The waiter goes downstairs.  Lucy comes on deck.  She saunters up next to Porter.}

LUCY.  Beautiful day.

PORTER.  Beautiful day.

LUCY.  I'm Lucy.

PORTER.  Porter.

LUCY.  Fall in love much, Porter?

PORTER.  I'm finding it to be an increasingly rare event.

LUCY.  You may have overcomplexified the concept.

PORTER.  You think so?

LUCY.  Maybe, it's possible.  My problem is I simplify it down too much.

PORTER.  My problem is I can't stay innocent about it.

LUCY.  Well that is a problem.

PORTER.  Why?

LUCY.  Cause you can't stay innocent.

PORTER.  I suppose you're right.

LUCY.  The more time passes, more you know, the less innocent you must be.

PORTER.  Do you think it's possible to maintain an innocent outlook on it?

LUCY.  On life?

PORTER.  On falling in love.

LUCY.  I don't know, it's too early in the morning for philosophy.

PORTER.  Sorry.

LUCY.  If you'd like to join me and my husband for drinks, however \ldots

PORTER.  That's awful.  How are you?

LUCY.  I expected it.

PORTER.  Still \ldots

LUCY.  For a long time.

PORTER.  Still \ldots

LUCY.  I'll be ok.

\emph{The waiter comes upstairs carrying Lucy's bag.  Lucy kisses the waiter.}

LUCY.  Say hi to your dogs for me.

\emph{Porter nods.  Lucy takes the waiter's arm.  Lucy and the waiter go down the ship's ramp together.  Porter puffs his pipe.}

PORTER.  My ancestors used to say ``make every encouter a fatality''.  Some part of you, and some part of the person you encounter, should die in the meeting.  Otherwise the meeting was less than it could have been.  That is why I say, on that particular crossing, there were two fatalities aboard the Zygos Taverna.

\emph{Porter de-boards.}
