Lying on my side is better than lying on my back. Lying face down is better than lying on my side, to lessen my movements. Lie on my back with my head on 3–4 pillows. Lie on my stomach with my head on 1–3 pillows\n\nHave a cat sit on me or girlfriend put hand on me. Having a cat sit on me encourages me to be still for the sake of another. We rest together. We breathe together. My girlfriend putting her hand on me does the same thing\n\nGet to the void place. Close my eyes. Let them totally relax—roll to the most relaxed place in their sockets. Extend that, like actively staring forward behind my eyelids. This is sort of like resisting being tickled. The urge to do TD movements are the tickle. The void place is resisting the tickle. Do this with my whole body. This is a type of resisting movement. It is the effortless place that is the result of much effort (which is effortless)\n\nRide my bicycle. The locked position of my arms works pretty well with riding a bicycle. Ditto pushing a shopping cart or a walker. My arms are still locked when doing these things but holding onto something feels good and the distraction of riding helps. Be careful of balance\n\nDon't do fine or repetitive movements. Typing is bad. Washing dishes is bad. Folding clothes is bad. You have to do them, but notice which ones are worse for you and at least be aware going into them that you will hurt\n\nSleep. 12 hours. A nap. Anything. Sleep helps me feel better. Being fully rested helps. If it gets too hard, lie down and rest or sleep until I'm ready to continue. Listen to delta waves\n\nGet to a quiet room and get quiet with the room. If I can't sleep, I just go somewhere quiet and I get quiet with the room. Rest\n\nEat a big meal. Filling myself with good food that takes a while to digest causes me calm while I'm digesting\n\nCum at least once a day. Helps\n\nTake hot showers and baths. The hot water relaxes my muscles\n\nDon’t question my movements—make them. Last, move normally (what is normal for me). It doesn't help to try and hide my movements or mute the sounds my throat makes. Life is harder with TD. Admit it. Let the movements happen. People who love you will understand—a lot of the world is sympathetic to movement disorders and it works best for me to grunt and shake as needed","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-10-28T13:24:35.000Z","updated_at":"2023-12-29T21:50:57.000Z","published_at":"2021-10-28T14:49:16.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"658ec2d30d1bac0001aaeee9","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"658ec2d50d1bac0001aaeff0","uuid":"ab80754f-ddb2-42fe-a630-30df0fee319f","title":"Listen to covers (songs)","slug":"listen-to-covers-songs-and-do-the-same-things-in-multiple-dimensions-imaginations-to-learn-differentially-about-what-is","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"I learn something about the song—the \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"original\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" song—when I listen to a cover\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Why do I like covers so much?\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"I think it's because when I do the same thing in multiple dimensions/imaginations, I learn, differentially, about what \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"is\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\".

Scared the next job won't come, scared they won't be able to make the rent or won't be able to eat! If you've never been afraid you wouldn't be able to eat, then you have no idea what I'm talking about—try becoming homeless and walk into a coffeehouse and ask for a cup of hot water because $0 is all you can afford. This is a reality for many people (and it's not their fault any more than it would be yours)\n\nSome people who work are afraid to do their work well because that would involve confronting the boss (who is doing illegal shit) (who will fire you for being moral). If you're determined to be moral in this life, even if you only succeed just a little, you will be faced with ethical conflicts at work—if you choose to act in an upright fashion, you will lose your job. That's something to fear!\n\nAnd of course, homeless people fear for their lives every day—these aren't useless people, they're people just like me who life scares because we can't get food or warmth or our medicine that keeps us sane\n\nWe even see this in the rest of the animal kingdom—an animal who is afraid for its life is acting unproductively. It's fishing for another chance at life, dodging, running, hiding, waiting—not gathering stones for the winter, not burrowing in its nest\n\nOur corporations have shaped themselves to cause this fear for our survival. They interrupt us. They fragment us. They have invented the \"probationary period\" wherein a person is hired—but without health benefits or on a reduced salary for a while at the beginning of your employment. They invented the concept of an employee working for a corporation without any access to the stock of the company—the owner makes all the money, the employees remain serfs their whole employment. The company conducts reviews of a new employee's ex-employers—the same opportunity is not provided for a new employee to review an employer's previous employees. A company can move to another country where a person may not be able to—think of that—a company is more mobile on the Earth than a human fucking being. A company provides these and more reasons for a person to be scared\n\nAnd people aren't productive when they're scared\n\nWe run around like defenseless animals\n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, in a society presumably obsessed with work and progress, why this fear is nurtured among our people. In a scientific society, who would have this?\n\nThe answer is we are anything but a scientific society. People are involved in making decisions that lead to worker fear. People are greedy. So a very few of us take bribes (large salaries or gifts of societal power) to maintain the system. If you accept a large salary, if you deny your kids a place to live as they're getting started in life, if you're creating a scary environment for your workers—then you are part of the problem\n\nThe mismanagement of this pandemic has created an environment of fear. Ignoring the problem, lying and saying it's not as bad as it is—causes fear among normal people. Normal people aren't ready to handle fear. A regular guy working, he doesn't have time to research pandemic facts.

My world is good. The old is carried slightly with me into each day. The new surrounds me, invites me to play with it. Everything I encounter seems my teacher since I try to learn from it\n\nI like some people and don't like some people—but I like myself for how I interact with all of them. I like some circumstances in my life and I don't like some circumstances—but I like myself for how I interact with all of them\n\nMy birth family—are at a distance. And at a distance they shall stay. The relationships' active parts are over. I have mourned them, learned from them, and am daily letting go of them\n\nMy dear GF, my dear boo—I love you in all our realness, in all that we actually are. I love you\n\nMy cousin Kristi, my friend—I love you and all the ideas we share\n\nEveryone else—you are a joy to me\n\nAnd so I find myself a happy phantom—a phantom because I am outside my life and beyond it—and happy because—because!—I'm happy just because. And this happy phantom has no right to bitch\n\nSo that's why you'll find me saying, \"Yes!\" and \"Let's do it!\" to everything that's offered. That's why the words that come out of my mouth will be cheerleading words.

It wanted me to worry. It told me that So and so is threatening to remove democrats from committees next year—I clicked on the article and the threat was to remove three democrats from committees. The threat is real but the title wants me to believe that all democrats will be removed. Why is it stated this way? Brevity? To make me click on the article? Probably. But most certainly the article is there to make me fear\n\nFear is the primary product of news\n\nI don't know why that is the case but through observation I have learned that it is true\n\nYou're either going to get omnicron (as we call it in this house)—or you're not. You're either going to die from coronavirus or you're going to die from something else. We may all get blown up by nuclear weapons—!\n\nThere's nothing you can do about it—right?\n\nNo, actually there are little things you can do. And doing them will make you feel better (and will make the world a better place)—But you can't save the world and you can't destroy it, either\n\nReading about how wrong the other side is—doesn't help. My parents made that mistake. They're political people, political activists, Christians. They think their side is right and they don't do much listening to the other side. To them, the other side is crazy. To them, the news is a reason to get angry. In fact, last I left them, all my dad and his new wife did at dinner was read each other leftist news articles and get angry\n\nI hate this sort of thing. I voted for Biden but I don't worship Biden. Biden was just the (much) lesser of two evils in the last election. That's my whole allegiance. That's as tied to candidates as I am. During Trump's presidency, I didn't go around personally attacking him. I hoped for his best! When Trump won, I said, \"I hope he rises to the challenge.\" He didn't—but I wished for it anyway. I want the best for Trump and this country and this world\n\nI always critiqued my mom and dad for being too invested in the news. My mom snaps back at this suggestion—\"Well (as of Obamacare) this is why some of us think politics is important.\" Politics is not important—all politics, from kindergarten cliques to presidential candidates, is simply about popularity—it's about who people like and who they are made to like by the news (by the gossip)\n\n\"Who's your guy?\" \"Who you gonna vote for?\" Those are questions asked by the common human being with the intention of starting an empty argument or forging an empty friendship. There is no substance which lies beyond those questions—only popularity, only who likes who\n\nThis is why I'm not about to get upset by the news. I have some fragmentary understanding that the news exists to rile me up. Don't we all know this? Think of the difference between the feelings you get when viewing the Associated Press versus viewing CNN—AP almost bores you to sleep while CNN makes me a little angry!\n\nPeople are so scared—we're so scared of dying that we run around doing insane things to prepare for the day when our time comes (when we die or when we're tested)—and you can't. There may be a civil war, but having a gun is not going to help you—if you buy a gun, you're starting the war. Tell me this—what is the motivation behind a person pursuing insane treatments for covid? (Like injecting disinfectant) The motivation is fear—extreme fear that I can hardly imagine\n\nFacebook and Twitter have failed us—their time is done. Their promotion of uninformed information and their promotion of controversial information stokes fear—may I remind you what Yoda said—\n\nFear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering\n\nI don't relish going to Star Wars for this morsel but it's true! Fear is the root of suffering and is the root of every step between them. We have all the information needed to live this moment fearlessly and the news isn't helping\n\nBeing afraid of the news isn't helping\n\nBeing afraid of the virus isn't helping\n\nBeing afraid in general is a bad habit we should divorce ourselves from\n\nI said earlier that there are things a single person can do that make a difference. There are. But they're not flashy. They're not political. They're things like (here's what I can do) washing the dishes for my baby so she has a clean kitchen to cook in. That's something I can actually do and it helps a lot—it even helps with the virus (in a soft way) I can hold my tongue with my methed-out landlord. This is something I can actually do and it makes a difference for the whole block we live on. I can get my vaccine (something small I can do that helps everyone—even people who decided not to get the vaccine)\n\nBut what can't I do (or what could I do that would be based on fear and cause a lot of problems)? I can't force my neighbor to vaccinate. I can't stockpile weapons planning for the end of the world. I can't save the 5 1/2 million people who covid's taken—nope, can't do a thing for them—they're dead, there is nothing I can do to bring them back\n\nThe news helps us worry about big things. But not a single one of us does big things without help from others—not even the president, not the CIA, no one anywhere does big things without collaborating. So the news creates a sort of horse, confined in a cage, being sparked in the ass electrically—and when this happens she tries to run and smacks her head against the cage. The news makes us fear things that we can't do a thing about—not directly, not totally\n\nWhat is to be done then? Small things. Like washing the dishes—mentioned above. I think if you follow me you will see that almost every decision almost everyone makes is a small one—we'd like to be important (and worry makes the mind feel important) but basically everything we control is small\n\nWill your small decisions add up to the political future you desire? It's doubtful!\n\nThis article is titled \"Don’t worry about the news\" not \"How to change the news\"—the world may end. Democrats may be removed from committees! Coronavirus could mutate again and kill us all. Nuclear war probably will kill us all\n\nMy point is you can't control it. So don't live in fear\n\nIt feels a whole lot better to be honest about what I can control—and what I can't. Do something about the first and forget about the second. That's the serenity prayer—Give me the wisdom to know what I can control (and what I can't) the courage to change some little things, and the strength to surrender before what I really cannot control","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-01-11T17:19:51.000Z","updated_at":"2023-12-29T21:35:01.000Z","published_at":"2022-01-11T18:39:04.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"658ec2d30d1bac0001aaeee9","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"658ec2d50d1bac0001aaf028","uuid":"8b2a4d5e-c3ae-4f80-abec-f1c0b0386e18","title":"Today is my birthday!

You were not there for me as a kid when my dad stood over me as I knelt by the toilet scraping shit from my training pants with my hands. You were not there for me when I was homeless. You were not there for me after I attempted suicide—you were not there! and I curse you to the very life you are already living—you are in hell. I will never speak to you again in this life.

Even if the conversation broke out into an argument, I could still meditate on the fact that our asses are comfortably in seats\n\nThese are all aspects of what's going on—they are viable points of focus for meditation","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-04-03T06:34:38.000Z","updated_at":"2023-12-29T14:25:41.000Z","published_at":"2022-04-03T18:05:38.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"658ec2d30d1bac0001aaeee9","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"658ec2d50d1bac0001aaf067","uuid":"1f63dfbe-3b51-436f-b3cf-3714849fd1b5","title":"Actively function as the cheerleader","slug":"actively-function-as-the-cheerleader","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Remember this always—to actively \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"not\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" function as the humiliator (as I was taught)\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"But even (or especially) in my hardest relationships, to act as the cheerleader, the encourager, the \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"hope\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"r, the one who brings light and joy and \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"cheer\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"!\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"When I fantasize, do not fantasize humiliation—fantasize \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"cheer\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"!\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"When I plan, do not plan for humiliation—plan for \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"cheer\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"!\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"When I act, do not ever act to humiliate—act to \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"cheer\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"!\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"This is my lesson in this life.

yoga block\n * feel pulse in wrist behind my back while breathing\n * squeeze a grippy ball stress reliever\n * hold myself like im suspended in water fluid movements + less clenching\n * lean my head + neck back\n * close 1 eye\n * empty my mind\n * get up + move my body\n * eat food\n * get cooler\n * glaze my eyes\n * get into the gamer zone\n * relax my anus\n * take a bath\n\nand recently i also\n\n * quiet my inner noise my dystonia—my movements—come with inner noise—like the noise volume turned up on my sensorium—it makes it so things rarely seem quiet—and i realize 10 years into dystonia that being physically still + quieting my inner noise are linked with a 2 way implication—if one is happening then the other is happening—therefore quieting my inner noise == becoming still\n * attend less (what can i really do) my motions are also part + parcel with a feeling that i must attend to the situation at hand—the less i feel i must attend—the less my motions—the more i am attending to everything—the more frenetic my movements—remembering (in a moment) to take a realistic stance on (what i can really do here) helps me to be calmer—to be still\n\ni have had dystonia for 10 years now (from 36—almost 46) i havent been able to work—my only income has been federal disability insurance that i paid into when i worked as a programmer—i have written books with td but typing really kills my shoulders so im staying away from it as much as possible + using voice to text—my wife drives us where we need to go + shops + fixes meals + otherwise takes care of me (we do this together)","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-01-04T11:51:28.000Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T14:17:12.000Z","published_at":"2024-01-04T12:31:08.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6596a6340d1bac0001ab00fe","uuid":"afdfa3d7-699d-42c3-85bc-4c3aa57e7616","title":"momentary
